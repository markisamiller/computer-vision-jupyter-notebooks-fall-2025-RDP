It also  \\ncomplements, and benefits from, the historic investments \\nCanada is making in its national defence and security \\nthrough its 2024 defence policy update Our North,  \\nStrong and Free. \\n\\nIt will make Canada more secure, especially for Canadians \\nliving in the North. It will support strong and resilient Arctic \\nand Northern communities. It will also serve to advance the \\ninterests and priorities of Indigenous Peoples and  \\nnortherners who call the Arctic home.\\n\\nCanada’s new policy is based on a shared vision of the  \\nArctic’s future; I am confident Canada will realize its  \\nambitions through this policy.\\n\\nThe Honourable Mélanie Joly, P.C., M.P. \\nMinister of Foreign Affairs\\n\\nCanada is at an inflection point in the Arctic. \\n\\nFor many years, Canada has aimed to manage the Arctic \\nand northern regions cooperatively with other states as a \\nzone of low tension that is free from military competition\\n\\nThis approach had significant benefits, uniting the Arctic \\nnations to advance cooperation on issues of common \\ninterest, such as sustainable development, environmental \\nprotection and scientific collaboration, including through  \\nthe establishment of the Arctic Council in Ottawa in 1996.\\n\\nHowever, the guardrails that we have depended on to \\nprevent and resolve conflict have weakened. Russia’s illegal \\nwar in Ukraine has made cooperation with it on Arctic issues \\nexceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future. Uncertainty \\nand unpredictability are creating economic consequences \\nthat Canadians are facing everyday.\\n\\nThreats to Canada’s security are no longer bound by \\ngeography; climate change is accelerating rapidly; and \\nnon-Arctic states, including China, are also seeking greater \\ninfluence in the governance of the Arctic. To respond, \\nCanada must be strong in the North American Arctic, and \\nit requires deeper collaboration with its greatest ally, the \\nUnited States. Canada must also maintain strong ties with  \\nits 5 Nordic allies, which are now also all NATO members.\\n\\nThe evolving security and political dynamics in the  \\nArctic have triggered a need for a recalibrated diplomatic \\napproach to advancing Canada’s national interests in the \\nregion, based on the principles of pragmatic diplomacy.\\n\\n The Arctic Foreign Policy, a diplomatic strategy, addresses \\nthe challenges and opportunities Canada faces today, as \\nwell as those it expects to face in the coming decades. It \\ngives Canada the diplomatic tools it needs to continue to \\nassert its sovereignty, advance its national security interests \\nand promote a stable, prosperous and secure Arctic. \\n\\nThis policy is built on, and benefits from, the knowledge \\nand perspectives of Indigenous Peoples who call the Arctic \\nhome. It comes from a place of understanding that there is \\na dark chapter in Government of Canada policy in the Arctic, \\nwhich includes forced relocations of Inuit to the High Arctic \\nand other colonial policies. These have inflicted significant \\nintergenerational trauma on Indigenous Peoples. \\n\\n2\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cForeword: Message from  \\nthe\\tMinister\\tof\\tNorthern\\tAffairs\\n\\nThe new Arctic Foreign Policy will expand and broaden \\nCanada’s international engagement, strengthen relations \\nwith our international partners and exercise Canada’s  \\nsovereignty in the Canadian Arctic. It will also advance \\ndomestic priorities, including enhancing knowledge of  \\nthe North, protecting the Arctic environment, and  \\nadvancing reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples  \\nthroughout the North. \\n\\nBy placing the invaluable perspectives, knowledge, and \\nwisdom of Indigenous Peoples in the North, who have \\ncalled the Arctic home since time immemorial, at the \\nforeground this new policy and its implementation, we will \\nensure that the Arctic remains a vibrant, prosperous, and \\nsecure region now and for future generations.\\n\\nThe Honourable Dan Vandal, P.C., M.P. \\nMinister of Northern Affairs\\n\\nReleased in 2019, the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework \\n(‘the Framework’) was co-developed with over 25 First \\nNations, Inuit, and Métis governments, organizations, \\nand territorial and provincial governments. It laid out a \\nshared vision to ensure that the needs and priorities of the \\nNorth remain paramount: “Strong, self-reliant people and \\ncommunities working together for a vibrant, prosperous and \\nsustainable Arctic and northern region at home and abroad, \\nwhile expressing Canada’s enduring Arctic sovereignty.” \\n\\nThe launch of Canada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy builds on \\nthe International Chapter of the Framework and is a pivotal \\nmoment in the realization of our shared vision for the Arctic. \\nInformed by engagements with Indigenous Peoples and \\nNortherners and their vast knowledge in the region, as well \\nas with territorial and provincial governments, this Policy \\nreflects the federal government’s international approach to \\nthe Arctic to ensure that Canada remains well-positioned  \\nas an Arctic leader. \\n\\nThe Arctic Foreign Policy will promote a safe, strong,  \\nand thriving future for those who live in the Arctic and  \\nthe North, while protecting Canada’s enduring Arctic  \\nsovereignty. It considers the shifting geopolitical context \\nand puts forward plans to ensure that the Canadian Arctic \\nremains strong and adaptable on the international stage, \\nnow and into the future. Just as Indigenous partners are \\ninstrumental in the ongoing implementation of the  \\nFramework, the success of this new foreign policy will \\ndepend on continued learning from the immeasurable \\nexperience, knowledge, and wisdom of First Nations, Inuit, \\nMétis, Modern Treaty and Self-Governing partners and \\ncommunities. This shared learning is critical to a strong and \\nsustainable Arctic and to the full and effective implemen-\\ntation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \\nIndigenous Peoples Act. \\n\\nThrough this Policy, Canada’s approach to the Arctic will be \\ndeveloped with respect for Indigenous self-determination \\nand the values, interests, cultures, and traditions of Arctic \\nand northern Indigenous Peoples, including weaving  \\ntraditional knowledge into Arctic decision-making  \\nat the global level. \\n\\n3\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cForeword: Message from  \\nthe Minister of National Defence\\n\\nCanada remains committed to contributing to NATO  \\nand NORAD’s awareness of the threat environment across \\nthe Arctic region, including in the North American Arctic.  \\nWe likewise support the continued leadership of  \\nlike-minded Arctic states on matters of security  \\nand defence.\\n\\nThe Arctic security and continental defence investments \\nmade in Our North, Strong and Free and NORAD  \\nModernization support NATO’s deterrence and  \\ndefence agenda by protecting the Alliance’s Northern  \\nand Western flanks. It ensures that Canada can engage  \\nin the world and deploy from a secure base in support  \\nof NATO allies, when needed.\\n\\nAs we expand and enhance our presence in the Arctic, we \\nrecognize that this will also impact the communities who \\ninhabit the region. Indigenous Peoples have called the \\nArctic home since time immemorial, and working with them \\nwill enhance the prosperity and defence of the region.  \\nOur government will continue to prioritize working with  \\nIndigenous communities in the Arctic and deepening  \\nour relationship with them.\\n\\nAs the world continues to evolve and threats intensify,  \\nthe connection between foreign policy and defence policy \\nmust remain strong for the protection of our country  \\nand our values. This Arctic Foreign Policy complements \\nCanada’s ongoing work in the region to expand our  \\npresence and safeguard our sovereignty in the Arctic. \\n\\nThe Honourable William Sterling Blair, P.C., C.O.M., M.P. \\nMinister of National Defence\\n\\nCanada has benefited enormously from our geography. \\nSurrounded by 3 oceans, and our closest ally to the south, \\nour country has enjoyed a degree of protection that has \\nhelped keep our borders safe and secure. That reality is \\nchanging in the Arctic. Where the polar ice caps provided \\nphysical protection, the region is now opening to the world \\nas it warms at 4 times the global average.\\n\\nIn the coming decades, the Arctic Ocean will become a vital \\nshipping route between Europe and Asia, while vast stores \\nof natural resources become increasingly accessible.  \\nThis growing access is already enticing nations to  \\nthe region, heightening security challenges and  \\ngeopolitical competition. \\n\\nCanada must urgently strengthen our presence in the Arctic \\nand northern regions as our adversaries aspire to a greater \\nrole in the region’s affairs. The physical threat of climate \\nchange is compounded by challenges from authoritarian \\nstates to the rules-based international order that Canada \\nand its allies strive to uphold. Simultaneously, the character \\nof conflict is changing with rapid technological and  \\ncyber advances.   \\n\\nCanada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy responds to these \\ngrowing challenges by focusing on 3 key areas: asserting \\nCanada’s sovereignty, advancing our interests in the region, \\nand promoting a stable, prosperous, and secure North.  \\nThe policy addresses current needs and challenges while  \\nanticipating how the region will change in the coming \\ndecades. It also provides the diplomatic tools we need \\nto partner with Northern communities to assert Canada’s \\nsovereignty and to support Arctic and Northern people  \\nso that they can thrive and remain secure.\\n\\nThe Arctic Foreign Policy complements the work and  \\ninvestments outlined in our new defence policy update  \\nOur North, Strong and Free, which was developed in part as \\na response to the emerging threats in the Arctic and around \\nthe world. Our North, Strong and Free focuses on  \\nCanadian values and strengths while underpinning  \\nour Arctic and Northern sovereignty, strengthening our  \\ndiplomatic influence, and leveraging our world-leading \\ncyber and space talent. It reinforces our capabilities and \\ncapacity in the region, in partnership with those  \\nwho live there.\\n\\n4\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cExecutive summary\\n\\nCanada is an Arctic nation. \\nCanada launched the co-developed Arctic and Northern \\nPolicy Framework (ANPF) in 2019, which sets out a  \\ncommon vision of the Arctic and the North, in which  \\nthe peoples there are thriving, strong and secure. \\n\\nSince then, strategic competition has intensified across the \\nglobe as major powers that do not share Canadian interests \\nand values seek to shape the international environment to \\ntheir advantage. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022, \\nfor example, has shaken the foundations of international \\ncooperation in the Arctic. \\n\\nAt the same time, the Arctic is experiencing the  \\nconsiderable impacts of climate change, with significant  \\nimplications for the security of the communities and people \\nwho live in the Arctic. By 2050, the Arctic Ocean will become \\nan increasingly viable shipping route between Europe and \\nAsia during the summer.\\n\\nMore than ever, the Arctic is a theatre of interest for many \\nnon-Arctic states and actors aspiring for a greater role in \\nArctic affairs. Canada’s adversaries also try to achieve  \\ninfluence through non-military tactics, including cyber \\nactivities, foreign interference and economic coercion.\\n\\nThe North American Arctic is no longer free from tension. \\nCanada must work even closer with its closest ally, the  \\nUnited States, to maintain a secure North American \\nhomeland. Canada should also be closer than ever  \\nto its Nordic allies.\\n\\nTo respond to these emerging geopolitical dynamics  \\nand to align more closely with the defence policy update  \\nOur North, Strong and Free, Canada has developed, in  \\npartnership with northern and Indigenous Peoples, the \\nArctic Foreign Policy to supplement the International  \\nchapter of the ANPF. This policy will help ensure that the \\nArctic remains a stable, prosperous and secure region  \\nfor future generations.\\n\\nThe Arctic Foreign Policy provides new funding over  \\nthe next 5 years to ensure that Global Affairs Canada1  \\nis fit-for-purpose in the Arctic. The policy also benefits  \\nCanadians who live in the Arctic and in the North,  \\nincluding by strengthening their ties and connections  \\nacross borders. \\n\\nTo achieve its objective of a stable, prosperous and secure \\nArctic, Canada will continue to assert its sovereignty. Canada \\nwill also advance its national interests through pragmatic \\ndiplomacy; lead on Arctic governance and multilateral \\nchallenges; and adopt a more inclusive approach  \\nto Arctic diplomacy.\\n\\nAs part of this policy, Canada will:\\n\\n•  appoint an Arctic ambassador \\n\\n•  open a new consulate in Anchorage, Alaska\\n\\n•  open a new consulate in Nuuk, Greenland\\n\\n•  initiate an Arctic security dialogue with the ministers  \\nof foreign affairs of like-minded states in the Arctic\\n\\n•  expand information sharing with relevant territorial and \\nprovincial governments and Indigenous leaders on \\nemerging and developing international Arctic security \\ntrends, including foreign interference threats\\n\\n•  support science and research coordination initiatives \\n\\nwith foreign policy considerations as related to research \\nsecurity and science in the Arctic \\n\\n•  launch boundary negotiations with the United States \\n\\nregarding the Beaufort Sea and finalize the implementa-\\ntion of the boundary agreement between Canada  \\nand the Kingdom of Denmark regarding Tartupaluk  \\n(Hans Island)\\n\\nCanada remains deeply committed to the full implementa-\\ntion of the ANPF, to Arctic state primacy and to upholding \\nthe rules-based international order2 in the Arctic. The Arctic \\nForeign Policy will provide new tools for Canada to deliver \\non the objectives set out in the ANPF in a changing  \\ngeopolitical context.\\n\\nThis foreign policy will secure its national interests  \\nand ensure stability and prosperity for the Indigenous  \\nPeoples who live in the Arctic and the North—including  \\nFirst Nations, Inuit, Métis, Modern Treaty and Self- \\nGoverning Partners—and other northerners. Canada’s \\ndiplomacy is stronger when it is informed by Indigenous \\nKnowledge, culture and practices, as well as by the lived \\nexperiences of northerners who call the Arctic home.\\n\\n1\\t Hereafter,\\tall\\tuses\\tof\\tthe\\tfirst-person\\tplural—we,\\tus,\\tour\\tand\\tours—are\\tin\\treference\\tto\\tGlobal\\tAffairs\\tCanada. \\n2\\tThe\\trules-based\\tinternational\\torder\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tis\\tthe\\tsum\\tof\\tinternational\\trules,\\tnorms\\tand\\tinstitutions\\tthat\\tgovern\\tinternational\\taffairs\\tthere.\\n\\n5\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cSTRATEGIC \\nCHALLENGES  \\nIN THE ARCTIC\\n\\nPhoto Credit: © Global Affairs Canada\\n\\n6\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0c1.  Russia  \\n\\n since 2022\\n\\nCanada has been clear that there will be no business as usual with Russia, at the Arctic \\nCouncil or elsewhere, since its illegal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\\n\\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally changed the geopolitical \\nlandscape, with spillover effects in the Arctic. It is an attack not only against Ukraine, \\nbut also on the fundamental principles of international relations, including respect  \\nfor sovereignty, territorial integrity and international law. \\n\\nIn addition to the existential threat Russian aggression poses to Ukraine and its people, \\nRussian president Putin’s war on Ukraine risks setting a broader post-Cold-War  \\nprecedent that borders can be redrawn through violence.\\n\\nNortherners understand how close a neighbour Russia is. Canada must be clear-eyed \\nabout the implications of its geographic proximity to Russia. Canadian Forces Station \\nAlert, on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, is closer to the Russian military’s air force base  \\nat Nagurskoye, Russia, than Iqaluit is to Ottawa or Toronto is to Winnipeg. \\n\\nFor over a decade, Russia has invested in modernizing its Arctic infrastructure and its \\nmilitary capabilities in the Arctic to develop resources and control access to the region, \\nwith particular emphasis on its own western region and approaches. It is looking to \\nprofit from climate change in the region and will continue promoting the development \\nof the Northern Sea Route as a major international shipping route. Given the strategic \\nimportance Russia places on its Arctic region, Canada expects these activities  \\nwill continue.\\n\\nRussia has also intensified its disinformation campaigns, conducted below-threshold \\nmilitary activities3, and crafted a vehement domestic narrative of a “hostile, unfriendly \\nWest,” in part to justify its own militarization of the Arctic. \\n\\nRussia’s historic posture has been to ensure sovereignty and control over its own Arctic \\nregion and to limit the role of non-Arctic states in Arctic affairs. However, because of \\nsanctions and of its massive expenditures on its illegal war against Ukraine, Russia \\nis increasingly reliant on China to fund and support the development of its projects \\nin the Arctic. These include investments in Arctic research, oil and gas development, \\nports and other critical infrastructure. We anticipate this trend will continue and lead to \\nincreased activity by China in the Russian Arctic. \\n\\nRussia and China are aligned in their desire to undermine the liberal-rules-based \\ninternational system, but the power asymmetry between them often highlights the \\ndivergence in their interests. Russia is increasingly dependent on China and is reversing \\nits historic posture by opening its Arctic to China. For instance, in July 2024, Russia and \\nChina, building on their 2022 statement to cooperate in the Arctic, conducted joint \\nmilitary exercises in the Russian High North. In addition, Russian and Chinese warships \\nhave conducted joint patrols in international waters off the Aleutian Islands; the  \\n2 countries’ coast guards have conducted joint patrols into the Bering Sea; and Russian \\nand Chinese military aircraft have been detected, tracked and intercepted by the North \\nAmerican Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) while flying in Alaska’s Air Defense \\nIdentification Zone. This demonstrates the continued deepening of Chinese-Russian \\nmilitary cooperation, particularly in the North Pacific approaches to the Arctic.\\n\\n3\\t\\t“Below-threshold\\tconflict,”\\talso\\tknown\\tas\\t“grey\\tzone\\tconflict,”\\trefers\\tto\\tcompetitive\\tinteraction\\tbetween\\tstates\\tthat\\tfalls\\t \\n\\t short\\tof\\ttraditional\\tarmed\\tconflict\\tbut\\tgoes\\tbeyond\\tnormal\\tpeaceful\\trelations.\\tSuch\\tconflict\\tinvolves\\tactions\\tthat\\tare\\t \\n\\t coercive\\tand\\taggressive\\tbut\\tdeliberately\\tdesigned\\tto\\tremain\\tbelow\\tthe\\tthreshold\\tof\\tarmed\\tconflict.\\tThese\\tactions\\t \\n\\t could\\tinclude:\\tinformation\\twarfare\\tand\\tpropaganda;\\tcyber\\tattacks\\tand\\tespionage;\\teconomic\\tcoercion;\\tpolitical\\t \\n\\t interference\\tand\\telection\\tmeddling;\\tthe\\tuse\\tof\\tproxy\\tforces\\tor\\tparamilitary\\tgroups;\\tor\\t“lawfare”\\tand\\t \\n\\t exploiting\\tlegal\\tambiguities.\\n\\n7\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0c2.  Evolving  \\n security  \\n threats across  \\n the Arctic\\n\\n8\\n\\nThe Arctic is a strategically important region for the defence of North America and the \\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO’s) northern and western flanks. However,  \\nthe defence architecture and threat picture differ across the circumpolar north. \\n\\nThe safety, security and defence of the Canadian Arctic comprise a fundamental \\npriority for the Government of Canada and are critical to the collective defence of North \\nAmerica. The Arctic regions of North America are protected by the armed forces of \\nCanada and the United States, individually and bilaterally, and through NORAD,  \\nwhich is binational.\\n\\nWhile the risk of military attack in the North American Arctic remains low, the region \\nrepresents a geographic vector for traditional and emerging weapons systems \\nthat threaten broader North American and transatlantic security. Canada is seeing \\na number of potential threats, including increased Russian activity in Canadian air \\napproaches, China’s regular deployment of dual-use—having both research and \\nmilitary application—research vessels and surveillance platforms to collect data, and a \\ngeneral increase in Arctic maritime activity. Adversaries and competitors also employ \\ndisinformation and influence campaigns, malicious cyber operations and espionage \\nand foreign interference activities to target Canadians, including northerners.\\n\\nClose partnership with the United States is essential to the maintenance of a secure, \\nstrong and well-defended North American homeland, on which the 2 countries’ mutual \\nprosperity depends. It is critical in deterring and defending against increasingly sophis-\\nticated threats to North America, including in the Arctic and its approaches in the North \\nAtlantic and North Pacific. We expect Canada–United States defence cooperation in \\nthe Arctic to continue to grow, as it is fundamental to both countries’ national  \\nsecurity interests.\\n\\nStrong and resilient Arctic and northern communities increase Canada’s defence \\nagainst threats. With increased tension and with competitors looking to exploit \\nvulnerabilities in the Canadian North, Canada must take action to build trust in public \\ninstitutions and deepen ties with like-minded states. Canada’s diplomacy and defence \\nand security policies must work hand in hand to keep these emerging threats in check.\\n\\nThe security of the European High North is also of critical importance to Canada’s \\nsecurity and economic well-being.\\n\\nThe European High North is a contested region militarily, including threats to critical \\ninfrastructure, maritime security, and safety, as well as access concerns. Russia has \\nestablished a strong military presence in the Arctic, including with air and naval  \\nplatforms equipped with missile systems capable of striking Europe and North  \\nAmerica and of disrupting Canada’s ability to project forces in support of allies and \\npartners. Russia’s below-threshold actions, military activities and continued weapons \\ntesting in the European High North and the Arctic are deeply troubling.\\n\\nNATO has strengthened its deterrence and defence posture, including in the European \\nHigh North, in response to the increased threat posed by Russia. The accessions of \\nFinland and Sweden to NATO, in 2023 and 2024 respectively, reinforced the Alliance by \\nbringing, among other things, their significant cold-weather experience and capabilities \\nto NATO, thereby bolstering its strategic posture in the European High North. Canada \\nwas the first country to ratify each of their accessions. Canada will continue to share \\ninformation on threats in the Arctic with allies and to support NATO operations and \\npresence in the European High North.\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cDespite the changing threat picture, it is not in Canada’s strategic interest that the Arctic \\nbecomes a theatre of military conflict. Canada will continue working with territorial  \\nand provincial governments, Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples and allies and  \\npartners throughout the Arctic region to enhance domain awareness, improve  \\ninformation sharing and strengthen interoperability and research security.\\n\\nCanada must also take action to mitigate the impact that current and emerging \\ndefence and security threats to the Arctic have on the people who live in the region \\nand who now find themselves at the frontlines of geopolitical competition.\\n\\nPhoto Credit: Joint Task Force (North) / Operation NUNALIVUT\\n\\n9\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cNorth Paciﬁc\\nOcean\\n\\nBering Sea\\n\\nUnited States\\n(Alaska)\\n\\nARCTIC CIRCLE\\n\\nC A N A D A\\n\\nR U S S I A\\n\\nArctic Ocean\\n\\nNorth \\nPole\\n\\nGreenland\\n(Denmark)\\n\\nNorth Atlantic \\nOcean\\n\\nIceland\\n\\nSweden\\n\\nNorway\\n\\nARCTIC CIRCLE\\n\\nFinland\\n\\n10\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0c3.  Adapting  \\n to new  \\n dynamics  \\n for Arctic \\n governance\\n\\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has had cascading impacts on the governance of the \\nArctic. While Arctic states continue to fulfill the important responsibility of governing \\nthe Arctic region at a time of unprecedented change, like-minded countries are taking \\ncoordinated action to ensure it is not business as usual with Russia.\\n\\nThe Arctic Council is the pre-eminent forum for international Arctic cooperation  \\nand governance. It brings together the 8 Arctic states, the 6 Permanent Participant  \\norganizations representing Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic, and observers to address  \\nsustainable development and the environmental protection of the Arctic. The role \\nof Arctic Indigenous Peoples, from the foundation of the Arctic Council in 1996 to \\nthe present, is one of the council’s greatest strengths and is unique in multilateral \\ngovernance. The council sets the bar for meaningful Indigenous engagement, which \\ncontinues to grow to this day. Arctic governance must be done with those who have \\nlived in the Arctic for thousands of years, recognizing the strength of shared knowledge \\nand decision making. \\n\\nMeetings with all members of the council at the ministerial and Senior Arctic Official  \\nlevels remain on hold. Arctic states and Permanent Participants are working at the \\nexpert and scientific level to advance important projects on climate change and \\nbiodiversity, emergency prevention and preparedness and sustainable development. \\nThese projects, along with the other work of the Arctic Council, are helping to drive \\nmeaningful change for people who live across the Arctic. This unique work, done in \\ncollaboration between the Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic and the Arctic states,  \\nis what makes the Arctic Council so valuable.\\n\\nTo ensure the maintenance of robust governance in the Arctic—governance that is \\ncapable of tackling the increasing challenges and opportunities the region is facing—\\ncooperation must continue at the Arctic Council. Canada must also identify new forums \\nand leverage existing ones in new ways to advance discussions on Arctic issues. Arctic \\nand northern Indigenous Peoples must be active partners in the conduct of  \\ninternational relations in the Arctic. \\n\\nArctic states also meet in other regional and international forums that contribute to \\nupholding the rules-based international order, including the Arctic Coast Guard Forum \\nand the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement. The latter came into force in 2021, \\nestablishing a precautionary 16-year ban on commercial fishing on the high seas of  \\nthe Arctic Ocean.\\n\\nArctic states also play a leading role in advancing Arctic interests in broader global \\nefforts through the UN system, such as the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) \\nban on heavy fuel oil in the Arctic.\\n\\nAn extensive international legal framework applies to the Arctic Ocean. The law of \\nthe sea, including as set out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), \\ndetermines states’ jurisdictions and their rights and obligations in various maritime \\nzones. These rules apply to the delineation of the outer limits of continental shelves, \\nnavigation, the management of natural resources, the protection of the marine environ-\\nment and other uses of the sea. Consistent with the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration4, Canada \\nremains committed to the orderly settlement of Arctic disputes in accordance with \\ninternational law and expects the same of other signatories, including Russia.\\n\\n4\\t\\tThe\\tIlulissat\\tDeclaration\\twas\\tsigned\\tby\\tthe\\t5\\tArctic\\tOcean\\tcoastal\\tstates\\t(Canada,\\tthe\\tUnited\\tStates,\\tthe\\tKingdom\\tof\\t \\n\\t Denmark,\\tNorway\\tand\\tRussia)\\tat\\tIlulissat,\\tGreenland,\\tin\\tMay\\t2008.\\tIn\\tthe\\tdeclaration,\\tthe\\t5\\tstates\\tpledged\\tto\\tenhance\\t \\n\\t their\\tscientific\\tand\\tenvironmental\\tcooperation\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tOcean.\\tThey\\talso\\tcommitted\\tto\\tthe\\torderly\\tsettlement\\tof\\t \\n\\t overlaps\\tin\\ttheir\\trespective\\textended\\tcontinental\\tshelves,\\tin\\taccordance\\twith\\tinternational\\tlaw.\\n\\n11\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cCanada has a clear interest in maintaining the structures of governance in  \\nthe Arctic that ensure Canada’s central role in guiding the region’s future.  \\nCanada especially values the Arctic Council because it provides a platform  \\nfor Indigenous Peoples to help shape circumpolar affairs.

Climate  \\n\\n change: the  \\n overarching  \\n threat\\n\\nClimate change is both the most pressing and the most proximate threat to Canada’s \\nsecurity in the Arctic and the people who live there. Its causes and effects are not \\nbound by countries’ official borders.\\n\\nClimate change is progressing at an alarming pace, with the Arctic warming 4 times \\nfaster than the global average, causing significant impacts on natural and human  \\nenvironments. These impacts serve as threat multipliers because changing environ-\\nmental conditions create additional opportunities for foreign adversaries and  \\ncompetitors to covertly or overtly operate in the Canadian Arctic.\\n\\nThe total surface area of Arctic Ocean ice is shrinking, with varied implications for \\nmaritime shipping, trade and resource extraction across the Arctic. Maritime traffic in \\nthe Arctic will continue to increase, which will drive further foreign interest in the region. \\nThis includes maritime traffic in Canada’s Arctic Archipelago, despite the risks and \\nhazards associated with the unpredictable ice conditions.\\n\\nWith retreating sea ice and new technologies improving navigation and accessibility, \\nforeign activity in the Arctic will continue to increase, bringing with it related safety, \\nsecurity and environmental challenges. With other Arctic states, Canada must be \\nprepared to respond.\\n\\nClimate change is also driving an increase in climate-related emergencies and  \\ndisrupting ecosystems that Arctic communities rely on for their livelihoods, with  \\nsignificant implications for the security of northerners, including Indigenous Peoples, \\nwho are disproportionately affected by these changes.\\n\\nNortherners, including Indigenous Peoples, have shared concerns about climate \\nchange and their ongoing efforts to improve their resiliency in the face of increased \\npressures on communities and livelihoods, food security and the destabilization of \\ncritical and civilian infrastructure. The disappearance of year-round ice cover and \\nchanges in the timing and durability of the floe edge; increasing subsidence due to \\npermafrost thaw; and a greater frequency and severity of wildfires are examples of the \\nimpacts of climate change on Arctic communities, all of which have both material and \\npsychological impacts.\\n\\nFor instance, communities in the North are often impacted by major wildfires. In 2023, \\nmore than half of the population of the Northwest Territories had to be evacuated. \\n\\nThere is an ongoing need to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change in the \\nArctic to reduce vulnerabilities. Canada must support Arctic and northern Indigenous \\nPeoples and other northerners in adapting to the environment as it is and will be—not \\nas one wishes it would be. \\n\\nIn parallel, climate change is driving interest in the Arctic as a sustainable and reliable \\nsource of critical minerals, such as lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare \\nearth elements integral to the transition to a low-carbon economy. For Canada and \\nits allies, the Arctic’s resource potential provides an opportunity to diversify critical \\nmineral production in partnership with territorial and provincial governments, Arctic \\nand northern Indigenous Peoples and local communities. This must be done carefully, \\nrespecting the livelihoods of local communities. \\n\\nClimate change is a global problem; it requires global solutions and multilateral collaboration.\\n\\n13\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0c5.  Increasing  \\n\\n challenges to  \\n Arctic states’  \\n primacy\\n\\nCanada’s approach to the Arctic is guided by the fundamental principle that the Arctic \\nshould be governed by the Arctic states in collaboration with Arctic and northern \\nIndigenous Peoples. As in other regions, strategic competition in the Arctic is growing, \\nwith non-Arctic states and actors increasingly expressing foreign policy or security \\naspirations, thereby pushing for greater roles in Arctic affairs.\\n\\nSince 2019, there has been a growing narrative among some non-Arctic states that \\nthey should have a greater say in Arctic governance. China, in particular, has expressed \\nan ambition to become a “polar great power,” by 2030.\\n\\nAmong China’s priorities in the Arctic are developing commercial shipping opportuni-\\nties, including a “Polar Silk Road,” as well as natural resource exploitation, including of \\ncritical minerals, oil and gas and fish. China is also active in Arctic research, much  \\nof which can be considered dual use.\\n\\nChina seeks to shape the international order into a more permissive environment for \\ninterests and values that increasingly deviate from Canada’s commitment to a rules-\\nbased international system. China can be expected to use all the tools at its disposal  \\nto advance its geopolitical interests, including in the Arctic. Canada will challenge China \\nwhen it ought to and cooperate when its interests align with China’s.\\n\\nChina, like all states, has rights and responsibilities related to its use of the world’s \\noceans that apply equally in the Arctic. For example, in accordance with UNCLOS, \\nChina can only conduct marine scientific research in the exclusive economic zone \\nof another state with the consent of that state. Canada will carefully review any such \\nrequests related to its own exclusive economic zone and provide or withhold consent \\nconsistent with the provisions of the convention.\\n\\n14\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy \\n\\x0cPhoto Credit: © Global Affairs \\nCanada\\n\\nConsistent with its Indo-Pacific Strategy and in collaboration with partners, Canada will \\nalways act on matters of Arctic governance to protect national and northern interests, \\nincluding when dealing with China. Canada will cooperate with China to address  \\npressing global issues—such as climate change—that have impacts on the Arctic.\\n\\nIn the Canadian Arctic, Canada will always work to protect Canada’s economic security, \\nsafeguard Canadian values and protect Canadians from malign influence.\\n\\nCanada will continue to work closely with the United States to counter all forms  \\nof malign influence and activity in the North American Arctic. \\n\\nIn the wider region, Canada will always uphold the founding principles that under-\\npinned the Ottawa Declaration in 1996 on the establishment of the Arctic Council. \\nThese include Canada’s commitment to the well-being of the inhabitants of the Arctic; \\nits commitment to sustainable development in the Arctic region, including economic \\nand social development, improved health conditions and cultural well-being; its  \\ncommitment to the protection of the Arctic environment; and its commitment to \\nensure full consultation with, and the involvement of, Indigenous Peoples and their  \\ncommunities and other inhabitants of the Arctic on Arctic Council activities.\\n\\nAt all times, Canada’s engagement in the Arctic will be focused first and foremost on \\npromoting and defending Canadian national interests.

Leveraging diplomacy to support national defence and security\\n\\nThe Government of Canada will continue to take a  \\ncomprehensive approach to Arctic security by prioritizing \\nthe security, interests and priorities of the Arctic region \\nand northerners, as well as Canadians more broadly. \\nCanada’s foreign and defence policies are closely \\nintertwined and complementary. Effective diplomacy \\nis critical for shaping the international environment to \\ndefend and advance Canadian national interests; it is  \\na first line of defence for Canada’s national security.  \\nCanada’s fundamental defence and security goal is  \\nto prevent and defuse potential crises before they can \\ndevelop into conflict.\\n\\nCanada’s national security is also supported by human \\nsecurity. Strong and resilient local communities are vital \\nto national defence.\\n\\nCanada engages in the Arctic from a position of strength \\nthanks to the Canadian Armed Forces’ (CAF’s) presence \\nand capabilities, exercises and operations, including \\nthose of the Canadian Rangers. Canadian Rangers are \\nactive, well-respected members of their communities, \\nand they play a critical role in demonstrating Canadian \\nsovereignty over the lands, waters and ice of Canada’s \\nNorth and Arctic.\\n\\nBuilding on the NORAD modernization investments \\nannounced in 2022, Canada’s defence policy update \\nOur North, Strong and Free identified the Government of \\nCanada’s most pressing priority as the continued asser-\\ntion of Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and northern \\nregions. Canada is making investments to ensure that \\nthe CAF has the capabilities required to operate in an \\nevolving geopolitical context. By 2030, Canada will have \\nalmost tripled its defence spending from 2015.\\n\\nStrengthened military capabilities will bolster the CAF’s \\nability to conduct and sustain operations in the Arctic \\nand create opportunities for strengthened collaboration \\nwith allies and partners. Canada regularly invites select \\nallies and partners to take part in Operation NANOOK, \\nthe CAF’s signature northern operation series. Canada \\nalso works with allies and partners on multinational \\nresearch and development activities relevant to the \\nconduct of defence and security operations in  \\nthe polar regions. \\n\\nIn addition to NORAD modernization and the defence \\npolicy update, Canada is pursuing historic investments \\nto increase its military capability in the maritime domain \\nin the Arctic. Ensuring that Canada’s internal waters in \\nthe Arctic are well defended is a critical component of \\nmaintaining a secure North American homeland. Canada \\nwill maintain strong defence capabilities in its internal \\nArctic waters, including in the Northwest Passage. \\n\\n17\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cHere is a summary of key defence  \\nand security investments:\\n\\n•  Several military capabilities will play a key role in  \\nexercising Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and \\nnorthern waters, including Canada’s 6 new Arctic \\nOffshore Patrol Ships; up to 15 new River Class \\nDestroyers; 11 new MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones;  \\nup to 16 new P-8A Poseidon multi-mission aircraft \\nspecialized in anti-submarine and anti-surface \\nwarfare; and 88 new F-35A fighter aircraft. \\n\\n•  Canada’s $38.6 billion plan to modernize NORAD will \\nsignificantly enhance domain awareness in the Arctic \\nand the North through the establishment of a  \\nnew northern approaches surveillance system to  \\ncomplement the North Warning System and further  \\ninvestment in space-based surveillance. It also \\nincludes further investment in space-based polar \\ncommunications; additional air-to-air refuelling aircraft \\nto support and extend the reach of CAF operations—\\nand NORAD operations—in Canada; additional and \\nlonger-range air-to-air missiles for Canada’s fighter \\nfleet; significant infrastructure upgrades at airfields \\nused to support NORAD forward operations; and  \\nmore than $4 billion in new funding for science  \\nand technology.\\n\\n•  The defence policy update announced an additional \\n$8.1 billion in spending over the next 5 years and  \\n$73 billion over the next 20 years to support  \\nCanada’s national defence and security in the Arctic. \\nThis includes a new fleet of airborne early warning \\nand control aircraft; specialized maritime sensors, \\nincluding some that can be deployed by Harry \\nDeWolf-class Arctic Offshore Patrol vessels; a new \\nfleet of tactical helicopters; and a new satellite \\nground station in the Arctic to enhance the use of \\nCanadian, U.S. and other Allied space capabilities. \\n\\n•  The defence policy update will also establish a new \\nnetwork of Northern Operational Support Hubs to \\nfurther enhance the CAF’s presence, responsiveness \\nand partnerships across the Arctic and the North \\nand invest in multi-use infrastructure that also meets \\nthe needs of the territories, Indigenous Peoples and \\nnorthern communities.\\n\\n•  In July 2024, Canada announced it would initiate new \\nspending programs to put the country on track to \\nreach NATO’s target of 2% of GDP spending by 2032. \\nThis will include the purchase of up to 12 convention-\\nally powered, under-ice-capable submarines by the \\nRoyal Canadian Navy.\\n\\n•  In 2024, the Government of Canada initiated the \\n\\nprocurement of 8 new icebreakers made in Canada \\nto support Canadian Coast Guard operations in the \\nArctic, including 2 polar icebreakers that will enable \\nyear-round icebreaker presence in the Arctic. The \\nicebreakers will contribute to the protection of the \\nmarine environment, the resupplying of communities \\nand the collection of data that enhances Canada’s \\nmaritime domain awareness in support of maritime \\nsafety and security, climate resilience and  \\nscientific research.\\n\\n•  In July 2024, Canada, the United States and Finland \\n\\nannounced an enhanced trilateral partnership called \\nthe ICE Pact. It is a collaborative effort to build best-\\nin-class Arctic and polar icebreakers and other Arctic \\nand polar capabilities in each of the countries by \\nsharing expertise, information and capabilities. This \\npartnership also bolsters the ability of like-minded \\nnations to uphold international rules, norms and \\nstandards to ensure safety and to sustain peace and \\nstability in the Arctic.\\n\\nThe diplomatic initiatives in the Arctic Foreign Policy will \\ncomplement all of these investments by better aligning \\nCanada’s strategic approaches and by strengthening \\nits relationships with its Arctic allies, with territorial and \\nprovincial governments and with Arctic and northern \\nIndigenous partners.\\n\\n18\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0ci.

Canada’s Arctic \\nsovereignty encompasses land, sea and ice. It extends \\nwithout interruption to the seaward-facing coasts of the \\nArctic islands and beyond. These islands are joined, not \\ndivided, by the waters between them and are bridged for \\na large part of the year by ice.\\n\\nIndigenous Peoples in Canada have used and occupied \\nthe ice and waters as they have used and occupied \\nthe lands for thousands of years. Every day, through a \\nwide range of activities, Arctic and northern Indigenous \\nPeoples and governments, as well as territorial and \\nprovincial governments and other northerners, share \\nstewardship over the Arctic lands and waters of Canada. \\nIt is through the reciprocal recognition of each other’s \\nmutual interests in these lands and waters that Canada \\nand Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples share in the \\nstewardship of them—further codified in modern treaties \\nand self-government agreements. Sovereignty and  \\nsovereign rights in the Arctic are inextricably linked  \\nto issues of Indigenous self-government. Canada  \\npossesses environmental, economic, cultural and  \\nhistorical interests unique to the region, the reality \\nand importance of which are clearly evidenced by \\nlong-standing usage.\\n\\nCanada will work with Arctic and \\nnorthern Indigenous partners to assert \\nshared interests and priorities in the \\nregion, such as through partnerships \\nwith the Inuit Marine Monitoring \\nProgram and the Indigenous \\nGuardians program.5 These initiatives \\nprovide Indigenous Peoples with \\ngreater opportunities to exercise \\nresponsibility for the stewardship of \\ntheir traditional lands, waters and ice.\\n\\nCanada intends to continue to act as a responsible \\nsovereign of its Arctic territories and waters, relying on \\nthe rules-based international order and supported by \\nhistorical and scientific evidence.

Managing Arctic boundaries through  \\n\\na rules-based approach\\n\\nAt a time when the rules-based international order  \\nis under unprecedented threat, it is critical that states \\nresolve their disputes responsibly, through dialogue \\nand negotiation. Canada has made resolving boundary \\ndisputes in accordance with international law one of the \\nfoundational principles of its foreign policy in the Arctic.\\n\\nEnhanced international cooperation on maritime \\nboundaries also helps secure states’ respective national \\ninterests over their resources, including energy, minerals, \\nfish and wildlife.\\n\\nCanada will advance efforts to resolve \\nArctic boundary disputes peacefully \\nand in accordance with international \\nlaw, including UNCLOS, and in \\nconsultation with Indigenous partners, \\nparticularly where these international \\nboundaries may affect treaty rights.\\n\\nCanada–Kingdom of Denmark \\nboundary agreement\\n\\nCanada, the Kingdom of Denmark, and \\nGreenland have resolved the maritime \\nboundary and long-time dispute over \\nTartupaluk. In June 2022, following \\n5 years of intensive negotiations, \\nthe Canadian, Nunavut, Danish and \\nGreenlandic governments agreed \\non a modernized single maritime \\nboundary, from the Lincoln Sea in \\nthe north to the Labrador Sea in \\nthe south—a distance of over 3,000 \\nkilometres—which established the \\nlongest bilateral maritime boundary \\nin the world. The agreement also \\nresolved the overlap in our respective \\ncontinental shelves in the Labrador Sea.\\n\\nWith the Kingdom of Denmark, \\nCanada agreed to divide the island \\nof Tartupaluk roughly in half; Canada \\nis now advancing discussions on an \\nagreed border regime for Tartupaluk, \\nwhich requires engagement with the \\nGovernment of Nunavut and local \\nInuit communities. This is the last step \\nbefore the agreement can come into \\nforce, which Canada is committed to \\ncompleting in the near future.\\n\\n24\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cExtended continental shelf\\n\\nCanada–United States  \\nBeaufort Sea boundary\\n\\nIn September 2024, Canada launched \\nnegotiations with the United States to \\nresolve the 2 countries’ long-standing \\nmaritime boundary dispute in the \\nBeaufort Sea. The area in question \\nis north of the Yukon and Alaska and \\nmeasures approximately 270,000 \\nsquare kilometres. Both countries claim \\njurisdiction over the disputed region \\nby way of differing legal interpretations \\nof the 1825 treaty between Russia and \\nGreat Britain.\\n\\nReflecting the Government of Canada’s \\ncommitment to partnership and \\nreconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, \\nthe boundary negotiations will involve \\nimpacted Inuit Treaty Organizations and \\nclose consultations with territorial and \\nIndigenous governments. \\n\\nIn December 2022, Canada filed \\nan addendum to its Arctic Ocean \\nextended continental shelf \\nsubmission with the Commission on \\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf \\nin response to Russia’s addendum, \\nwhich was filed in March 2021. Russia’s \\naddendum greatly expanded the size \\nof the continental shelf included in its \\nsubmission and tripled the area that \\noverlaps with Canada’s own continental \\nshelf. Canada’s 2022 addendum \\nrebalanced the overlap area.\\n\\nIn December 2023, the United \\nStates published the outer limits \\nof its extended continental shelf \\nin the western Arctic Ocean. This \\nannouncement offers an opportunity \\nfor Canada to renew negotiations \\nwith the United States regarding the \\noverlap of the countries’ respective \\ncontinental shelves.

This has long been a shared \\n\\nprinciple of the Arctic states and has produced a long period  \\n\\nof peaceful cooperation and development in the region.\\n\\n 1. Strengthening Canada’s partnerships with Arctic allies\\n\\ni.  The United States \\n\\nThe United States is Canada’s closest partner and ally  \\nin the Arctic, and this collaboration extends across many \\nshared interests. Collaboration is advanced by Canada’s \\nextensive diplomatic network of 13 missions across the \\nUnited States and through various bilateral mechanisms.\\n\\nWith the United States, Canada shares a unique  \\nrelationship shaped by geography, history, shared values, \\ncommon interests and strong people-to-people connec-\\ntions. This is especially the case in the Arctic, particularly \\namong Indigenous Peoples, whose history, culture and \\nconnections transcend national borders. \\n\\nThe Canada–United States defence partnership is \\nessential to maintaining a secure North American  \\nhomeland. Canada welcomes the continued partici-\\npation of the United States’ military and coast guard in \\nCanada-led exercises and operations in Canada’s  \\nArctic and North.\\n\\nGoing forward, Canada will continue to advance bilateral cooperation with the United \\nStates in the North at all levels of government in existing areas of importance and explore \\nnew avenues of cooperation in critical areas of national interest, including: security and \\nsafety; the defence of North America; science and research technology; energy security; \\nsupply chains; climate change; critical minerals; sustainable development; Indigenous \\ncross-border mobility; economic development; marine and terrestrial conservation; and the \\nprotection of transboundary species, including salmon and the Porcupine caribou herd.\\n\\n26\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cii.   The Nordic states\\n\\nCanada maintains close relations with its Nordic Arctic \\nneighbours; specifically, the Kingdom of Denmark \\n(consisting of Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe \\nIslands), Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. These \\nclose relationships are underpinned by shared values, \\na common outlook on the world and a shared commit-\\nment to ensuring a peaceful and stable Arctic through \\nthe enduring success of NATO. They continue to grow \\nstronger, with a particularly marked increase in dialogue \\nand cooperation since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now \\nmore than ever, it is critical for Canada to have strong \\npartnerships with the Nordic states, as Canada and they \\nare all now members of NATO and Russia’s actions have \\ncomplicated cooperation in multilateral spaces of Arctic \\ngovernance. Examples of Canada’s close relationships \\nwith its Nordic Arctic neighbours include the following:\\n\\n•  In 2022, Canada was the first country to ratify  \\n\\nthe accessions of Finland and Sweden to NATO.\\n\\n•  In June 2023, Canada’s prime minister was the \\ninvited guest at the Nordic prime ministers’  \\nannual meeting, in Iceland.\\n\\n•  In June 2024, the Government of Canada committed \\nup to $20 million in funding for an international \\nresearch initiative on the sustainable development \\nof the Arctic in collaboration with NordForsk, an  \\norganization under the Nordic Council of Ministers. \\nIt will support collaborative and multi-disciplinary \\nscientific efforts and contributions from across the \\nArctic region and include Indigenous perspectives.\\n\\n•  In September 2024, Canada’s minister of foreign affairs \\nand the premier of Nunavut co-hosted representa-\\ntives from the Kingdom of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, \\nNorway and Sweden for the first Canada-Nordic \\nStrategic Dialogue, in Iqaluit, Nunavut.  \\n\\nCanada is committed to deepening its partnership \\nwith the Nordic countries as friends and allies with \\ncommon values and shared stewardship over the Arctic. \\nStrengthening Canada’s cooperation will also help it \\nrespond to new threats and below-threshold activities by \\nits adversaries in both the North American Arctic and the \\nEuropean High North. \\n\\nWorking in collaboration with other \\nfederal departments, we will increase \\nour support for bilateral and regional \\ncooperation with the Kingdom of \\nDenmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway \\nand Sweden in Arctic science and \\ntechnology, climate change, culture, \\nIndigenous-to-Indigenous ties, natural \\nresources, sustainable development \\nthrough trade and infrastructure and \\ndefence and security.\\n\\nWe will also create a new position \\nin one of Canada’s Nordic missions \\nwith responsibility for increasing \\ncoordination and information sharing, \\nincluding on security issues,  \\nwith Nordic partners.\\n\\nPhoto Credit: © Global Affairs Canada\\n\\n27\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cTo do this, we will open new consulates in Anchorage, \\nAlaska, and Nuuk, Greenland.\\n\\nAlaska is a key partner on a range of issues, including \\nborder security and crossings, security and defence in \\nthe Arctic, climate resilience and conservation, energy \\nsecurity, critical minerals and Indigenous affairs. \\n\\nMembers of the CAF are stationed in Alaska to support \\nthe NORAD mission and work alongside their U.S. military \\ncounterparts in the defence of North America.\\n\\nIn addition, the Yukon also has mature and close-knit \\nbilateral relations with Alaska from both a political and \\ntrade perspective. \\n\\niii. The North American Arctic: Alaska and Greenland\\n\\nThe North American Arctic encompasses the vast  \\nnorthern territories of 3 countries: Alaska (the United \\nStates) in the west; northern Canada in the centre;  \\nand Greenland (the Kingdom of Denmark) in the east.  \\nThe relationships in this region are unique due to  \\ngeographical proximity and the ancestral relations  \\nthat exist between Indigenous Peoples, which give rise  \\nto a number of shared interests, including on security, \\ndefence, climate change, sustainable development, \\ncritical minerals, trade, culture and Indigenous mobility.\\n\\nThe ANPF emphasizes increasing cooperation among \\nfederal, territorial, provincial and Indigenous govern-\\nments and other organizations in and across the  \\nCanadian Arctic and with Canada’s North American  \\nArctic partners.\\n\\nThe Arctic Foreign Policy complements this by \\nre-emphasizing the importance of deepening Canada’s \\ndiplomatic engagement with its neighbours, the United \\nStates, including Alaska, and the Kingdom of Denmark, \\nincluding Greenland. This will make the Canadian and \\nNorth American Arctic more secure and create new \\nopportunities for economic cooperation, scientific  \\ncollaboration and cultural exchange. \\n\\nThe consulate in Anchorage will help promote trade and \\neconomic ties between Canada’s territories and provinces and \\nAlaska; improve security and defence partnerships; strengthen \\ncollaboration on environmental and wildlife issues; engage with \\nAlaskan communities, including Indigenous communities; and \\nsupport cross-border people-to-people ties. \\n\\n28\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cMany ties, both formal and informal, have been forged \\nover the years at all levels of government and between \\nInuit organizations in Canada and Greenland. Several \\nbilateral initiatives have been advanced in recent years, \\nincluding the Letter of Intent for Cooperation on the \\nPikialasorsuaq (2023) and the Memorandum of Under-\\nstanding between the Government of Greenland and the \\nGovernment of Nunavut (2022). However, cooperation to \\ndate has largely occurred organically, without an  \\noverarching foreign policy framework.\\n\\nIn recognition of the growing importance of Greenland  \\nas a key Arctic partner, a more coordinated approach \\nwith Greenland, including with the government of  \\nNunavut, is a priority in ensuring that Canadian  \\ninterests are being advanced effectively.\\n\\nThe consulate in Nuuk will be a \\nvaluable resource for coordinating \\nand advancing Canadian interests in \\nGreenland, enhancing bilateral and \\ncommercial relations, facilitating \\nresearch collaboration and supporting \\nincreased engagement and \\ncollaboration across many  \\npolicy spaces.\\n\\nWe welcome Greenland’s \\ncommitment to open a \\nrepresentational office in Canada.\\n\\nPhoto Credit: © Global Affairs Canada\\n\\n29\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0c2.  Holding  \\n Russia  \\n accountable\\n\\nRussia represents a generational geopolitical challenge. \\nAlthough Russia accounts for 50% of the Arctic  \\ngeographically, bilateral cooperation between Canada \\nand Russia, including in the Arctic, will remain  \\nexceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nCanada will continue to hold Russia accountable in regional \\nand multilateral forums for its actions and counter disinformation \\npromoted by the Russian regime, including through Canada’s \\nleadership of the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism. This includes \\ncountering disinformation targeting communities  \\nin the Canadian Arctic. \\n\\nAlongside allies and partners, Canada will continue confronting \\nRussian aggression, including through Canada’s enduring  \\nsupport for Ukraine, and by continuing to meet NATO  \\ndefence commitments.\\n\\nTogether with the United States, Canada will defend NATO’s \\nwestern flank, and with Arctic allies, Canada will defend NATO’s \\nnorthern regions and approaches.\\n\\nCanada acknowledges that the actions of the Putin \\nregime do not always reflect the values of the Russian \\npeople. This policy clearly differentiates between  \\ngovernment actions and those of the broader Russian \\npopulation, including its Indigenous Peoples, who them-\\nselves have been marginalized by the Russian regime.\\n\\nAcross all multilateral bodies, Canada will maintain its \\npolicy of limited engagement with Russian officials. \\nIt is for Russia to create the conditions that will enable \\na return to political engagement and cooperation by \\nending its war in Ukraine and acting in accordance  \\nwith international law.\\n\\n30\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy \\n\\x0c3.  Pragmatic  \\n diplomacy  \\n with non-  \\n Arctic states  \\n and actors\\n\\nWhile Canada will continue to prioritize cooperation  \\nwith Arctic states, especially when it comes to setting \\nthe rules that govern the region, cooperation with a \\nwider set of actors is beneficial and necessary to address \\nchallenges to the Arctic emanating from global issues, \\nsuch as climate change.\\n\\nGiven the prospect of growing competition in the Arctic, \\nCanada will be strategic in prioritizing pragmatic  \\ncooperation with non-Arctic states and actors that  \\nalign with Canadian values, interests and objectives.\\n\\nCanada will be guided by the following principles:\\n\\n › Respect for Arctic states’ sovereignty, sovereign rights and  \\n\\njurisdiction in the Arctic.\\n\\n › Support for the rules-based international order in the Arctic  \\n\\nand a demonstrated commitment to regional peace and stability.\\n\\n › Respect for Indigenous self-determination, Indigenous rights and the values, \\n interests, cultures and traditions of Arctic Indigenous Peoples, including the  \\nparticipation of Indigenous Peoples in Arctic decision making, and other  \\nArctic inhabitants.\\n\\n › Respect for the extensive legal framework that applies to the Arctic Ocean,  \\n\\nincluding UNCLOS.\\n\\n › Recognition of interests and expertise that are relevant to, and aligned with,  \\n\\nCanada’s Arctic and northern priorities, as well as its national defence  \\nand security interests.\\n\\n › Maintaining a commitment to uphold and advance democratic values,  \\nhuman rights and gender equality according to international standards,  \\nregulations and principles.\\n\\n › Openness with regard to scientific data sharing and collaboration  \\nwith Canadian researchers and local communities, including their  \\nrepresentative governments.\\n\\n › Commitment to sustainable development, conservation, environmental  \\n\\nprotection and fighting climate change. \\n\\nEngagement with non-Arctic states and actors will be \\nchanneled through a variety of multilateral forums, such \\nas the Arctic Council, appropriate UN bodies, NATO and \\nthe Arctic Security Forces Roundtable, as well as treaties \\nthat apply to the Arctic, such as the Central Arctic Ocean \\nFisheries Agreement, and bilateral and multilateral  \\nplatforms and projects that we will drive with other \\nfederal departments and agencies.\\n\\nGoing forward, based on the above principles, Canada \\nwill place particular emphasis on cooperation with \\nnon-Arctic states and actors in 2 regions: the North \\nAtlantic and the North Pacific.\\n\\n31\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cThe North Atlantic\\n\\nCanada will strengthen engagement \\non Arctic matters with the European \\nUnion, the United Kingdom and other \\nkey North Atlantic states through \\nestablished mechanisms, such as the \\nCanada–European Union Strategic \\nPartnership Agreement.

To ensure that the Canadian Arctic remains a region that \\nis stable, prosperous and secure, we need to deepen our engagement with \\nlike-minded states, as well as with territorial and provincial governments, \\nIndigenous Peoples and other domestic partners.\\n\\nTo lead this effort, we will establish the position of Arctic ambassador.\\n\\nThe ambassador’s responsibilities will include making linkages between domestic issues \\nand those relating to Canada’s foreign affairs; serving as Canada’s Senior Arctic Official and \\nadvancing Canada’s polar interests in multilateral forums; engaging with counterparts in \\nArctic and non-Arctic states, as well as with Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic; and raising \\nawareness internationally of Indigenous rights in the Arctic context. The ambassador will \\nalso support the work of Global Affairs Canada and other departments on Arctic research \\nsecurity.  In carrying out these duties, the ambassador will work closely with Arctic and \\nnorthern Indigenous Peoples, territorial and provincial governments and other northerners. \\n\\nThe ambassador will serve as a representative in our diplomatic corps and distinguish \\nhimself or herself by ensuring that the Arctic Foreign Policy remains connected to the reality \\nof Canadians living in the Arctic. The ambassador will also play an important role in Canada’s \\nbroader efforts toward reconciliation. The ambassador will have an office in Canada’s North.\\n\\nPhoto Credit: Arctic Council Secretariat / Linnea Nordström\\n\\n40\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cii.   Northern and Indigenous diplomacy  \\n\\n  on the world stage\\n\\nCanada remains committed to providing international \\nplatforms for northerners, including territorial, provincial \\nand Indigenous partners and youths, to engage in and to \\nrepresent their own international Arctic views, especially \\non issues that impact their rights or jurisdiction. Canada \\nalso welcomes made-in-the-North initiatives to support \\nhomegrown policy development that enhances northern \\nand Indigenous diplomacy on the world stage.\\n\\n  a. Sub-national governments\\n\\nArctic and northern public governments play a strategic \\nrole in Canada’s Arctic diplomacy efforts. Canada \\nremains committed to including territorial government \\nofficials in the Canadian delegation to Arctic  \\nCouncil meetings. \\n\\n  b.  Arctic and northern Indigenous diplomacy\\n\\nThe Arctic Foreign Policy recommits to enhancing the \\nrepresentation and participation of Arctic and northern \\nIndigenous Peoples in relevant negotiations and \\ninternational forums, such as the Arctic Council and the \\nUnited Nations, including the UN Permanent Forum on \\nIndigenous Issues, and all other bodies that Arctic and \\nnorthern Indigenous Peoples judge to affect them.\\n\\nWe have heard clearly from Arctic and northern \\nIndigenous partners that they are looking for more than \\na platform where they are only one voice consulted \\namong many. Instead, Indigenous partners require and \\ndemand meaningful continuous engagement to actively \\npartake in and shape decision making at the international \\nlevel that reflects their roles as rights holders. We will  \\nuphold the role of Arctic and northern Indigenous  \\nPeoples as active partners in the conduct of interna-\\ntional relations in the Arctic and support their efforts  \\nto advance this goal.\\n\\nThe Arctic Athabaskan Council, Gwich’in Council  \\nInternational and the Inuit Circumpolar Council currently \\nsit at the Arctic Council as Permanent Participants  \\nwith membership from Canada.\\n\\nSince 2020, Canada has increased funding to the  \\n3 Permanent Participants in Canada, allowing each of \\nthem to receive up to $650,000 each year. This support \\nis strengthening Indigenous voices in international Arctic \\nmatters, particularly at the Arctic Council.\\n\\nWith Transport Canada, we will \\nsupport opportunities for the Inuit \\nCircumpolar Council Canada to \\nrepresent Inuit Knowledge and \\nperspectives in international forums, \\nincluding on Arctic shipping and \\nenvironmental matters at the IMO.\\n\\nCanada will also support similar efforts by other Arctic \\nand northern Indigenous Peoples to increase their \\nrepresentation at relevant international forums to \\nensure their rights and perspectives inform decision \\nmaking at the global level. Canada will work with  \\nIndigenous partners to identify possible ways of  \\nimproving the capacity and role of Indigenous Peoples  \\nin international Arctic affairs. \\n\\nCanada remains strongly committed to the ANPF’s \\nobjective of providing Arctic and northern youths with \\nadditional opportunities to participate in, and benefit \\nfrom, Canada’s international Arctic agenda. We have \\nleveraged support for UArctic (an international network \\nof universities, colleges, research institutes and other \\norganizations concerned with education and research in \\nand about the Arctic) to provide opportunities for Canadi-\\nans to study in different parts of the circumpolar Arctic, to \\ngenerate regional solutions and to support collaboration \\nin Indigenous research and education.\\n\\n41\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cPhotos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada\\n\\niii. Northern and Indigenous representation  \\n\\n  at Global Affairs Canada\\n\\nIndigenous Peoples and northerners are  \\nunderrepresented at Global Affairs Canada, and  \\nsustained efforts are needed to boost recruitment  \\nand retention.\\n\\nIn line with the Future of Diplomacy, the department is \\ndeveloping a new external recruitment strategy that will \\nbe launched in 2025. The strategy will support outreach \\nacross Canada to identify Canadians with the skills  \\nneeded to deliver on our various mandates and will \\ninclude specific outreach to under-represented  \\ncommunities, including among Indigenous Peoples  \\nand northerners.\\n\\nTo support our recruitment efforts and \\nincrease Indigenous perspectives in the \\ndepartment, we will establish a paid \\nArctic and northern Indigenous youth \\ninternship program that will consider \\nthe need of Arctic and northern \\nIndigenous youths to remain close  \\nto their families and communities  \\nand ensure that appropriate support  \\nis in place.\\n\\nWe will also work with partners to \\nidentify other avenues for increasing \\nthe representation of Indigenous \\nPeoples and northerners at Global \\nAffairs Canada. \\n\\n42\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0c2.  Advancing Indigenous  \\n and northern foreign  \\n policy priorities\\n\\nBroadening Canada’s international engagement to  \\ncontribute more directly to domestic issues, such as \\nclosing socio-economic gaps, supporting infrastructure \\ndevelopment, enhancing knowledge of the North,  \\nprotecting the Arctic environment and advancing  \\nreconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, remains a priority. \\nKey issues include those described below.\\n\\ni.  Cross-border mobility\\n\\nFirst Nations, Inuit and Métis communities in Canada’s \\nArctic and North share long-standing spiritual, cultural, \\npolitical, economic, social and family connections with \\nIndigenous communities in the United States and Green-\\nland. The introduction of modern international borders \\nand the associated controls on cross-border mobility \\nhave negatively impacted Indigenous Peoples’ ability \\nto maintain familial, economic and cultural ties and \\ntraditional practices.\\n\\nPhotos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada\\n\\nCanada has been working with \\nIndigenous partners and the United \\nStates, Denmark and Greenland to find \\nsolutions to address border crossing \\nand migration challenges faced by First \\nNations, Inuit and Métis Peoples. \\n\\nThis commitment is reflected in Action \\nPlan Measure Shared Priorities 52 of the \\nAction Plan to implement the United \\nNations Declaration on the Rights of \\nIndigenous Peoples Act. \\n\\nTo address border mobility challenges \\nfaced by First Nations, Inuit and Métis \\nPeoples who live in the United States, \\nincluding Alaska, Canada intends \\nto bring forward legislation and \\nregulatory measures.\\n\\n43\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cii.   Market access\\n\\nIndigenous Peoples also face unjustifiable barriers to \\ntrade—barriers that also restrict international market \\naccess to Indigenous-harvested and -produced goods, \\nsuch as seal fur and ivory products.\\n\\nThe traditional harvesting of seals and other species by \\nInuit and other Indigenous Peoples of Canada is both \\na sustainable and a valuable contributor to Arctic and \\nnorthern communities. Trade barriers by key partners, \\nsuch as the United States, the European Union and other \\ncountries, have a broad detrimental impact on life in \\nCanada’s remote Arctic and northern communities.\\n\\nIn August 2024, Canada submitted \\na response to the European \\nCommission’s review of its regulation \\non the trade of seal products. Canada \\nrequested that the European Union \\nrepeal its regulations and replace \\nthem with rules that offer access  \\nto ethically and sustainably  \\nharvested products.\\n\\nCanada will continue to advocate \\nfor a repeal of the seal product ban. \\nWe will also promote awareness of \\nsustainable seal products and harvest \\nmanagement by hosting officials-level \\ndialogues with Arctic countries and \\nIndigenous partners at our missions  \\nto the European Union and the  \\nUnited States.\\n\\nPhoto Credit: © Global Affairs Canada\\n\\n44\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0ciii. Indigenous Knowledge and participation\\n\\nCanada supports Indigenous advocacy against pervasive \\ncolonial approaches to Arctic science and research, \\nwhich marginalize and discredit Indigenous Knowledge \\nand participation.\\n\\niv. Indigenous languages\\n\\nIndigenous languages such as Inuktut8 are essential to \\nthe preservation of Indigenous culture and the well- \\nbeing of Indigenous Peoples and communities. Canada \\nwill therefore enhance its efforts to work with its Arctic \\nand northern Indigenous partners to facilitate the \\nexchange of knowledge and best practices related \\n to Indigenous language assessment, monitoring  \\nand revitalization.\\n\\nWe will continue to support \\nequitable research partnerships \\nat the international level between \\nIndigenous and non-Indigenous \\nresearchers, such as the Canada–Inuit \\nNunangat–United Kingdom Arctic \\nResearch Programme.\\n\\nLooking forward, we will continue \\nto contribute to federal efforts on \\na broader range of northern and \\nIndigenous priorities, and we will \\ncollaborate with Arctic and northern \\nIndigenous partners, territorial \\nand provincial governments and \\nother northerners on international \\nadvocacy as appropriate. This includes \\npromoting investment in critical \\nminerals development; transportation; \\nenergy and electrification; broadband \\nconnectivity; cultural diplomacy; and \\nthe conservation of the Porcupine \\ncaribou herd. We will also work with \\nIndigenous partners, Canadian Heritage \\nand other relevant government \\ndepartments to advocate for the \\nrepatriation from across the globe of \\nartifacts originating from First Nations, \\nInuit and Métis communities.\\n\\n8\\t Inuktut\\tis\\tthe\\tfirst\\tlanguage\\tused\\tin\\tInuit\\tNunaat,\\tand\\tthe\\tmajority\\tof\\tInuit\\tNunaat\\tresidents\\tcontinue\\tto\\tspeak\\tInuktut\\tas\\ttheir\\tfirst,\\tonly\\tor\\tpreferred\\tlanguage.\\t \\n\\t Therefore,\\tto\\tuphold\\tthe\\tinherent\\tdignity\\tof\\tInuit,\\tsupporting\\tInuktut\\tin\\tthis\\tcontext\\tas\\ta\\tfirst\\tor\\tlater\\tlanguage\\taligns\\twith\\tthe\\tbroader\\tpurposes\\tof,\\tamong\\t \\n\\t other\\tthings,\\tworking\\tin\\tpartnership\\tto\\tdemonstrate\\tand\\tpromote\\tshared\\trespect\\tfor\\tthe\\thistory\\tand\\timportance\\tof\\tInuktut\\tand\\tfor\\tsocio-economic\\t \\n\\t and\\tcultural\\tdevelopment.\\n\\n45\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cv.   Supporting northern and Indigenous  \\n\\n  trade and export\\n\\nIn line with Canada’s inclusive approach to trade and  \\nits Export Diversification Strategy, we are committed  \\nto supporting northern and Indigenous exporters in  \\naccessing global markets.\\n\\nThe Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) recognizes that \\nbuilding strong relationships with our northern and \\nIndigenous partners is key to this mission. Dedicated \\ntrade commissioners, based in regional offices for British \\nColumbia and the Yukon; Alberta and the Northwest  \\nTerritories; Quebec and Nunavut; Manitoba and \\nSaskatchewan; and Atlantic Canada, work closely with \\nCanadian businesses in the Arctic and northern regions \\nto support their global expansion. The TCS network \\nalso continues to actively support and develop tailored \\nprogramming for northern and Indigenous exporters, \\nincluding through business delegations and export \\ntraining and accelerator programs, among other ways.\\n\\nAttracting foreign direct investment (FDI) into northern \\nand Indigenous communities will also play a vital role in \\neconomic and infrastructure development in the region. \\nThrough our increasing engagement with Northern and \\nIndigenous communities via the CanExport Community \\nInvestments program, we will continue to support \\nmunicipalities and economic development organizations \\nin seeking and retaining FDI in the North while ensuring \\nthat Canada’s environmental and national security  \\ninterests are protected.  \\n\\n3.  Transforming Global  \\n\\n\\tAffairs\\tCanada’s\\tdomestic\\t \\n engagement processes\\n\\nWe are committed to pursuing an ongoing collaborative \\napproach to domestic engagement that is informed by \\nearly, sustained and meaningful engagement with  \\nterritorial and provincial governments, Arctic and  \\nnorthern Indigenous governments and organizations  \\nand northerners more generally.\\n\\n46\\n\\nThe Arctic Cooperation Advisory \\nCommittee is a Canadian forum \\nfor the engagement of relevant \\nfederal departments, territorial \\nand provincial governments and \\nPermanent Participant partners on the \\ndevelopment and implementation of \\nCanada’s international Arctic policy, \\nincluding Arctic-Council-related \\nmatters. It will remain an important \\nmechanism for dialogue and \\nengagement on the development and \\nimplementation of Canada’s Arctic \\nForeign Policy. \\n\\nWe are committed to exploring \\ndistinctions-based engagements with \\nFirst Nations, Inuit, Métis, Modern Treaty \\nand Self-Governing Partners from \\nCanada’s Arctic and North.\\n\\nFor example, we are committed to \\nengaging directly with Inuit through the \\nInuit-Crown Partnership Committee as \\nwe apply the Inuit Nunangat Policy to \\nour programs, policies and services.\\n\\nIn addition, we will expand \\nopportunities for territorial and \\nprovincial governments and Arctic \\nand northern Indigenous partners to \\njoin or support Canadian delegations \\nat bilateral or international Arctic \\nmeetings and treaty negotiations if, in \\nsuch meetings and negotiations, their \\nrights or interests could potentially  \\nbe impacted. \\n\\nWe will also continue to provide a \\ncritical coordination function for \\nmulti-stakeholder Arctic events to \\nsupport a strong Canadian presence.\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe Arctic is a region of tremendous opportunity thanks \\nto its plentiful resources and resilient people. \\n\\nHowever, Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, rapidly  \\nadvancing climate change and increasing interest in \\nthe Arctic from non-Arctic states has led to increased \\ncompetition and geopolitical tension in the region. \\n\\nTo ensure that the Arctic remains stable, prosperous and \\nsecure and to fully implement the objectives laid out \\nin the International chapter of the ANPF, Canada needs \\na diplomatic strategy that responds to this evolving \\ngeopolitical context.\\n\\nThe Arctic Foreign Policy reorients Canada’s approach \\nto the Arctic based on a clear-eyed assessment of the \\nthreats Canada faces today, and those it anticipates in \\nthe future. It aligns Canada’s foreign and defence policy \\nto ensure the security of Canadians and ensures that \\ntogether with its allies, Canada can guard against and \\ndefend itself against threats from its adversaries  \\nin the Arctic.\\n\\nBy reinforcing the pillars of Arctic governance and the \\nprinciples of the rules-based international order, this \\npolicy will help to safeguard the collective interests  \\nof the peoples of the Arctic from those who would  \\nseek to impose their wills. \\n\\nThis policy will strengthen our relationships with  \\nterritorial and provincial governments, Arctic and  \\nnorthern Indigenous governments and organizations  \\nand other northerners. It will produce new and more \\neffective ways of working together on Arctic diplomacy \\nthat will transform Canada’s approach  \\nto international engagement.\\n\\nCanadian diplomacy has a role to play in building \\nrenewed relationships with First Nations, Inuit, Métis, \\nModern Treaty and Self-Governing Partners; relationships \\nthat are based on the recognition of rights, respect  \\nand partnership.\\n\\nThe Arctic Foreign Policy is built on a vision of shared \\ncooperation and prosperity for all the peoples of the \\nArctic who are committed to peace and stability.  \\nTogether, we can realize this future and ensure Canada’s \\nplace as a leader in the Arctic for generations to come.\\n\\nPhoto Credit: © Global Affairs Canada\\n\\n47\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy\\x0cAnnex: Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy  \\ndevelopment process and Canada’s Arctic  \\nand\\tNorthern\\tPolicy\\tFramework\\t(ANPF),\\t \\npublished in 2019\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy  \\ndevelopment process\\n\\nIn the spirit of the principle of “nothing about us without \\nus,” the Arctic Foreign Policy was developed on the basis \\nof extensive and distinctions-based engagement and \\non collaboration and cooperation with domestic rights \\nholders from Canada’s Arctic and North, including First \\nNations, Inuit, Métis, Modern Treaty and Self-Governing \\nPartners and organizations; the territorial governments \\n(the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and the Yukon); \\nand provincial governments (Manitoba, Newfoundland \\nand Labrador and Quebec). We engaged partners in a \\nvariety of formats, including bilateral meetings, regional \\nround-table discussions and ANPF  \\ngovernance mechanisms.\\n\\nThe Arctic Foreign Policy is guided by all relevant \\ntreaties and self-government agreements with Arctic \\nand northern Indigenous partners, including obligations \\nCanada has to Indigenous Peoples under those treaties \\nand agreements, and the rights recognized and affirmed \\nunder section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. It is further \\nguided by the Yukon Northern Affairs Program  \\nDevolution Transfer Agreement (2003), the Northwest \\nTerritories Devolution Agreement (2014), the United \\nNations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples \\n(endorsed by Canada in 2020), the Inuit Nunangat Policy \\n(2022) and the Nunavut Lands and Resources Devolution  \\nAgreement (2024).\\n\\nThe policy development process was also informed by \\nengagement with like-minded Arctic states; specifically, \\nthe Kingdom of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, \\nSweden and the United States.  \\n\\n48\\n\\nPhoto Credit: © Global Affairs Canada\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy \\n\\x0cCanada’s ANPF\\n\\nCanada’s Arctic Foreign Policy complements and \\nsupports the implementation of the ANPF, which was \\npublished in 2019. The ANPF was co-developed with \\nover 25 First Nations, Inuit and Métis governments and \\norganizations, as well as with territorial and  \\nprovincial governments. \\n\\nThe ANPF sets out a common vision of a future where \\nArctic and northern peoples are thriving, strong and \\nsafe. The framework includes a co-developed policy \\nstatement and the whole-of-government International \\nchapter, which articulates Canada’s goals and objectives \\nfor the circumpolar Arctic in 3 key areas that  \\nremain in effect:\\n\\n1. Strengthening the rules-based  \\ninternational order in the Arctic \\n\\n2. More clearly defining Canada’s  \\n\\nArctic boundaries \\n\\n3.

It will make Canada more secure  especially for Canadians  living in the North. It will support strong and resilient Arctic  and Northern communities. It will also serve to advance the  interests and priorities of Indigenous Peoples and   northerners who call the Arctic home.  Canada’s new policy is based on a shared vision of the   Arctic’s future; I am confident Canada will realize its   ambitions through this policy.  The Honourable Mélanie Joly  P.C.  M.P.  Minister of Foreign Affairs  Canada is at an inflection point in the Arctic.   For many years  Canada has aimed to manage the Arctic  and northern regions cooperatively with other states as a  zone of low tension that is free from military competition  This approach had significant benefits  uniting the Arctic  nations to advance cooperation on issues of common  interest  such as sustainable development  environmental  protection and scientific collaboration  including through   the establishment of the Arctic Council in Ottawa in 1996.  However  the guardrails that we have depended on to  prevent and resolve conflict have weakened. Russia’s illegal  war in Ukraine has made cooperation with it on Arctic issues  exceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future. Uncertainty  and unpredictability are creating economic consequences  that Canadians are facing everyday.  Threats to Canada’s security are no longer bound by  geography; climate change is accelerating rapidly; and  non-Arctic states  including China  are also seeking greater  influence in the governance of the Arctic. To respond   Canada must be strong in the North American Arctic  and  it requires deeper collaboration with its greatest ally  the  United States. Canada must also maintain strong ties with   its 5 Nordic allies  which are now also all NATO members.  The evolving security and political dynamics in the   Arctic have triggered a need for a recalibrated diplomatic  approach to advancing Canada’s national interests in the  region  based on the principles of pragmatic diplomacy.   The Arctic Foreign Policy  a diplomatic strategy  addresses  the challenges and opportunities Canada faces today  as  well as those it expects to face in the coming decades. It  gives Canada the diplomatic tools it needs to continue to  assert its sovereignty  advance its national security interests  and promote a stable  prosperous and secure Arctic.   This policy is built on  and benefits from  the knowledge  and perspectives of Indigenous Peoples who call the Arctic  home. It comes from a place of understanding that there is  a dark chapter in Government of Canada policy in the Arctic   which includes forced relocations of Inuit to the High Arctic  and other colonial policies. These have inflicted significant  intergenerational trauma on Indigenous Peoples.   2  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Foreword: Message from   the\\tMinister\\tof\\tNorthern\\tAffairs  The new Arctic Foreign Policy will expand and broaden  Canada’s international engagement  strengthen relations  with our international partners and exercise Canada’s   sovereignty in the Canadian Arctic. It will also advance  domestic priorities  including enhancing knowledge of   the North  protecting the Arctic environment  and   advancing reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples   throughout the North.   By placing the invaluable perspectives  knowledge  and  wisdom of Indigenous Peoples in the North  who have  called the Arctic home since time immemorial  at the  foreground this new policy and its implementation  we will  ensure that the Arctic remains a vibrant  prosperous  and  secure region now and for future generations.  The Honourable Dan Vandal  P.C.  M.P.  Minister of Northern Affairs  Released in 2019  the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework  (‘the Framework’) was co-developed with over 25 First  Nations  Inuit  and Métis governments  organizations   and territorial and provincial governments. It laid out a  shared vision to ensure that the needs and priorities of the  North remain paramount: “Strong  self-reliant people and  communities working together for a vibrant  prosperous and  sustainable Arctic and northern region at home and abroad   while expressing Canada’s enduring Arctic sovereignty.”   The launch of Canada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy builds on  the International Chapter of the Framework and is a pivotal  moment in the realization of our shared vision for the Arctic.  Informed by engagements with Indigenous Peoples and  Northerners and their vast knowledge in the region  as well  as with territorial and provincial governments  this Policy  reflects the federal government’s international approach to  the Arctic to ensure that Canada remains well-positioned   as an Arctic leader.   The Arctic Foreign Policy will promote a safe  strong    and thriving future for those who live in the Arctic and   the North  while protecting Canada’s enduring Arctic   sovereignty. It considers the shifting geopolitical context  and puts forward plans to ensure that the Canadian Arctic  remains strong and adaptable on the international stage   now and into the future. Just as Indigenous partners are  instrumental in the ongoing implementation of the   Framework  the success of this new foreign policy will  depend on continued learning from the immeasurable  experience  knowledge  and wisdom of First Nations  Inuit   Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-Governing partners and  communities. This shared learning is critical to a strong and  sustainable Arctic and to the full and effective implemen- tation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples Act.   Through this Policy  Canada’s approach to the Arctic will be  developed with respect for Indigenous self-determination  and the values  interests  cultures  and traditions of Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples  including weaving   traditional knowledge into Arctic decision-making   at the global level.   3  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Foreword: Message from   the Minister of National Defence  Canada remains committed to contributing to NATO   and NORAD’s awareness of the threat environment across  the Arctic region  including in the North American Arctic.   We likewise support the continued leadership of   like-minded Arctic states on matters of security   and defence.  The Arctic security and continental defence investments  made in Our North  Strong and Free and NORAD   Modernization support NATO’s deterrence and   defence agenda by protecting the Alliance’s Northern   and Western flanks. It ensures that Canada can engage   in the world and deploy from a secure base in support   of NATO allies  when needed.  As we expand and enhance our presence in the Arctic  we  recognize that this will also impact the communities who  inhabit the region. Indigenous Peoples have called the  Arctic home since time immemorial  and working with them  will enhance the prosperity and defence of the region.   Our government will continue to prioritize working with   Indigenous communities in the Arctic and deepening   our relationship with them.  As the world continues to evolve and threats intensify    the connection between foreign policy and defence policy  must remain strong for the protection of our country   and our values. This Arctic Foreign Policy complements  Canada’s ongoing work in the region to expand our   presence and safeguard our sovereignty in the Arctic.   The Honourable William Sterling Blair  P.C.  C.O.M.  M.P.  Minister of National Defence  Canada has benefited enormously from our geography.  Surrounded by 3 oceans  and our closest ally to the south   our country has enjoyed a degree of protection that has  helped keep our borders safe and secure. That reality is  changing in the Arctic. Where the polar ice caps provided  physical protection  the region is now opening to the world  as it warms at 4 times the global average.  In the coming decades  the Arctic Ocean will become a vital  shipping route between Europe and Asia  while vast stores  of natural resources become increasingly accessible.   This growing access is already enticing nations to   the region  heightening security challenges and   geopolitical competition.   Canada must urgently strengthen our presence in the Arctic  and northern regions as our adversaries aspire to a greater  role in the region’s affairs. The physical threat of climate  change is compounded by challenges from authoritarian  states to the rules-based international order that Canada  and its allies strive to uphold. Simultaneously  the character  of conflict is changing with rapid technological and   cyber advances.     Canada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy responds to these  growing challenges by focusing on 3 key areas: asserting  Canada’s sovereignty  advancing our interests in the region   and promoting a stable  prosperous  and secure North.   The policy addresses current needs and challenges while   anticipating how the region will change in the coming  decades. It also provides the diplomatic tools we need  to partner with Northern communities to assert Canada’s  sovereignty and to support Arctic and Northern people   so that they can thrive and remain secure.  The Arctic Foreign Policy complements the work and   investments outlined in our new defence policy update   Our North  Strong and Free  which was developed in part as  a response to the emerging threats in the Arctic and around  the world. Our North  Strong and Free focuses on   Canadian values and strengths while underpinning   our Arctic and Northern sovereignty  strengthening our   diplomatic influence  and leveraging our world-leading  cyber and space talent. It reinforces our capabilities and  capacity in the region  in partnership with those   who live there.  4  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Executive summary  Canada is an Arctic nation.  Canada launched the co-developed Arctic and Northern  Policy Framework (ANPF) in 2019  which sets out a   common vision of the Arctic and the North  in which   the peoples there are thriving  strong and secure.   Since then  strategic competition has intensified across the  globe as major powers that do not share Canadian interests  and values seek to shape the international environment to  their advantage. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022   for example  has shaken the foundations of international  cooperation in the Arctic.   At the same time  the Arctic is experiencing the   considerable impacts of climate change  with significant   implications for the security of the communities and people  who live in the Arctic. By 2050  the Arctic Ocean will become  an increasingly viable shipping route between Europe and  Asia during the summer.  More than ever  the Arctic is a theatre of interest for many  non-Arctic states and actors aspiring for a greater role in  Arctic affairs. Canada’s adversaries also try to achieve   influence through non-military tactics  including cyber  activities  foreign interference and economic coercion.  The North American Arctic is no longer free from tension.  Canada must work even closer with its closest ally  the   United States  to maintain a secure North American  homeland. Canada should also be closer than ever   to its Nordic allies.  To respond to these emerging geopolitical dynamics   and to align more closely with the defence policy update   Our North  Strong and Free  Canada has developed  in   partnership with northern and Indigenous Peoples  the  Arctic Foreign Policy to supplement the International   chapter of the ANPF. This policy will help ensure that the  Arctic remains a stable  prosperous and secure region   for future generations.  The Arctic Foreign Policy provides new funding over   the next 5 years to ensure that Global Affairs Canada1   is fit-for-purpose in the Arctic. The policy also benefits   Canadians who live in the Arctic and in the North    including by strengthening their ties and connections   across borders.   To achieve its objective of a stable  prosperous and secure  Arctic  Canada will continue to assert its sovereignty. Canada  will also advance its national interests through pragmatic  diplomacy; lead on Arctic governance and multilateral  challenges; and adopt a more inclusive approach   to Arctic diplomacy.  As part of this policy  Canada will:    appoint an Arctic ambassador     open a new consulate in Anchorage  Alaska    open a new consulate in Nuuk  Greenland    initiate an Arctic security dialogue with the ministers   of foreign affairs of like-minded states in the Arctic    expand information sharing with relevant territorial and  provincial governments and Indigenous leaders on  emerging and developing international Arctic security  trends  including foreign interference threats    support science and research coordination initiatives   with foreign policy considerations as related to research  security and science in the Arctic     launch boundary negotiations with the United States   regarding the Beaufort Sea and finalize the implementa- tion of the boundary agreement between Canada   and the Kingdom of Denmark regarding Tartupaluk   (Hans Island)  Canada remains deeply committed to the full implementa- tion of the ANPF  to Arctic state primacy and to upholding  the rules-based international order2 in the Arctic. The Arctic  Foreign Policy will provide new tools for Canada to deliver  on the objectives set out in the ANPF in a changing   geopolitical context.  This foreign policy will secure its national interests   and ensure stability and prosperity for the Indigenous   Peoples who live in the Arctic and the North—including   First Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-  Governing Partners—and other northerners. Canada’s  diplomacy is stronger when it is informed by Indigenous  Knowledge  culture and practices  as well as by the lived  experiences of northerners who call the Arctic home.  1\\t Hereafter \\tall\\tuses\\tof\\tthe\\tfirst-person\\tplural—we \\tus \\tour\\tand\\tours—are\\tin\\treference\\tto\\tGlobal\\tAffairs\\tCanada.  2\\tThe\\trules-based\\tinternational\\torder\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tis\\tthe\\tsum\\tof\\tinternational\\trules \\tnorms\\tand\\tinstitutions\\tthat\\tgovern\\tinternational\\taffairs\\tthere.  5  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy STRATEGIC  CHALLENGES   IN THE ARCTIC  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  6  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 1.  Russia     since 2022  Canada has been clear that there will be no business as usual with Russia  at the Arctic  Council or elsewhere  since its illegal  full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally changed the geopolitical  landscape  with spillover effects in the Arctic. It is an attack not only against Ukraine   but also on the fundamental principles of international relations  including respect   for sovereignty  territorial integrity and international law.   In addition to the existential threat Russian aggression poses to Ukraine and its people   Russian president Putin’s war on Ukraine risks setting a broader post-Cold-War   precedent that borders can be redrawn through violence.  Northerners understand how close a neighbour Russia is. Canada must be clear-eyed  about the implications of its geographic proximity to Russia. Canadian Forces Station  Alert  on Ellesmere Island  Nunavut  is closer to the Russian military’s air force base   at Nagurskoye  Russia  than Iqaluit is to Ottawa or Toronto is to Winnipeg.   For over a decade  Russia has invested in modernizing its Arctic infrastructure and its  military capabilities in the Arctic to develop resources and control access to the region   with particular emphasis on its own western region and approaches. It is looking to  profit from climate change in the region and will continue promoting the development  of the Northern Sea Route as a major international shipping route. Given the strategic  importance Russia places on its Arctic region  Canada expects these activities   will continue.  Russia has also intensified its disinformation campaigns  conducted below-threshold  military activities3  and crafted a vehement domestic narrative of a “hostile  unfriendly  West ” in part to justify its own militarization of the Arctic.   Russia’s historic posture has been to ensure sovereignty and control over its own Arctic  region and to limit the role of non-Arctic states in Arctic affairs. However  because of  sanctions and of its massive expenditures on its illegal war against Ukraine  Russia  is increasingly reliant on China to fund and support the development of its projects  in the Arctic. These include investments in Arctic research  oil and gas development   ports and other critical infrastructure. We anticipate this trend will continue and lead to  increased activity by China in the Russian Arctic.   Russia and China are aligned in their desire to undermine the liberal-rules-based  international system  but the power asymmetry between them often highlights the  divergence in their interests. Russia is increasingly dependent on China and is reversing  its historic posture by opening its Arctic to China. For instance  in July 2024  Russia and  China  building on their 2022 statement to cooperate in the Arctic  conducted joint  military exercises in the Russian High North. In addition  Russian and Chinese warships  have conducted joint patrols in international waters off the Aleutian Islands; the   2 countries’ coast guards have conducted joint patrols into the Bering Sea; and Russian  and Chinese military aircraft have been detected  tracked and intercepted by the North  American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) while flying in Alaska’s Air Defense  Identification Zone. This demonstrates the continued deepening of Chinese-Russian  military cooperation  particularly in the North Pacific approaches to the Arctic.  3\\t\\t“Below-threshold\\tconflict ”\\talso\\tknown\\tas\\t“grey\\tzone\\tconflict ”\\trefers\\tto\\tcompetitive\\tinteraction\\tbetween\\tstates\\tthat\\tfalls\\t  \\t short\\tof\\ttraditional\\tarmed\\tconflict\\tbut\\tgoes\\tbeyond\\tnormal\\tpeaceful\\trelations.\\tSuch\\tconflict\\tinvolves\\tactions\\tthat\\tare\\t  \\t coercive\\tand\\taggressive\\tbut\\tdeliberately\\tdesigned\\tto\\tremain\\tbelow\\tthe\\tthreshold\\tof\\tarmed\\tconflict.\\tThese\\tactions\\t  \\t could\\tinclude:\\tinformation\\twarfare\\tand\\tpropaganda;\\tcyber\\tattacks\\tand\\tespionage;\\teconomic\\tcoercion;\\tpolitical\\t  \\t interference\\tand\\telection\\tmeddling;\\tthe\\tuse\\tof\\tproxy\\tforces\\tor\\tparamilitary\\tgroups;\\tor\\t“lawfare”\\tand\\t  \\t exploiting\\tlegal\\tambiguities.  7  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Evolving    security    threats across    the Arctic  8  The Arctic is a strategically important region for the defence of North America and the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO’s) northern and western flanks. However    the defence architecture and threat picture differ across the circumpolar north.   The safety  security and defence of the Canadian Arctic comprise a fundamental  priority for the Government of Canada and are critical to the collective defence of North  America. The Arctic regions of North America are protected by the armed forces of  Canada and the United States  individually and bilaterally  and through NORAD    which is binational.  While the risk of military attack in the North American Arctic remains low  the region  represents a geographic vector for traditional and emerging weapons systems  that threaten broader North American and transatlantic security. Canada is seeing  a number of potential threats  including increased Russian activity in Canadian air  approaches  China’s regular deployment of dual-use—having both research and  military application—research vessels and surveillance platforms to collect data  and a  general increase in Arctic maritime activity. Adversaries and competitors also employ  disinformation and influence campaigns  malicious cyber operations and espionage  and foreign interference activities to target Canadians  including northerners.  Close partnership with the United States is essential to the maintenance of a secure   strong and well-defended North American homeland  on which the 2 countries’ mutual  prosperity depends. It is critical in deterring and defending against increasingly sophis- ticated threats to North America  including in the Arctic and its approaches in the North  Atlantic and North Pacific. We expect Canada–United States defence cooperation in  the Arctic to continue to grow  as it is fundamental to both countries’ national   security interests.  Strong and resilient Arctic and northern communities increase Canada’s defence  against threats. With increased tension and with competitors looking to exploit  vulnerabilities in the Canadian North  Canada must take action to build trust in public  institutions and deepen ties with like-minded states. Canada’s diplomacy and defence  and security policies must work hand in hand to keep these emerging threats in check.  The security of the European High North is also of critical importance to Canada’s  security and economic well-being.  The European High North is a contested region militarily  including threats to critical  infrastructure  maritime security  and safety  as well as access concerns. Russia has  established a strong military presence in the Arctic  including with air and naval   platforms equipped with missile systems capable of striking Europe and North   America and of disrupting Canada’s ability to project forces in support of allies and  partners. Russia’s below-threshold actions  military activities and continued weapons  testing in the European High North and the Arctic are deeply troubling.  NATO has strengthened its deterrence and defence posture  including in the European  High North  in response to the increased threat posed by Russia. The accessions of  Finland and Sweden to NATO  in 2023 and 2024 respectively  reinforced the Alliance by  bringing  among other things  their significant cold-weather experience and capabilities  to NATO  thereby bolstering its strategic posture in the European High North. Canada  was the first country to ratify each of their accessions. Canada will continue to share  information on threats in the Arctic with allies and to support NATO operations and  presence in the European High North.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Despite the changing threat picture  it is not in Canada’s strategic interest that the Arctic  becomes a theatre of military conflict. Canada will continue working with territorial   and provincial governments  Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples and allies and   partners throughout the Arctic region to enhance domain awareness  improve   information sharing and strengthen interoperability and research security.  Canada must also take action to mitigate the impact that current and emerging  defence and security threats to the Arctic have on the people who live in the region  and who now find themselves at the frontlines of geopolitical competition.

Adapting    to new    dynamics    for Arctic   governance  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has had cascading impacts on the governance of the  Arctic. While Arctic states continue to fulfill the important responsibility of governing  the Arctic region at a time of unprecedented change  like-minded countries are taking  coordinated action to ensure it is not business as usual with Russia.  The Arctic Council is the pre-eminent forum for international Arctic cooperation   and governance. It brings together the 8 Arctic states  the 6 Permanent Participant   organizations representing Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic  and observers to address   sustainable development and the environmental protection of the Arctic. The role  of Arctic Indigenous Peoples  from the foundation of the Arctic Council in 1996 to  the present  is one of the council’s greatest strengths and is unique in multilateral  governance. The council sets the bar for meaningful Indigenous engagement  which  continues to grow to this day. Arctic governance must be done with those who have  lived in the Arctic for thousands of years  recognizing the strength of shared knowledge  and decision making.   Meetings with all members of the council at the ministerial and Senior Arctic Official   levels remain on hold. Arctic states and Permanent Participants are working at the  expert and scientific level to advance important projects on climate change and  biodiversity  emergency prevention and preparedness and sustainable development.  These projects  along with the other work of the Arctic Council  are helping to drive  meaningful change for people who live across the Arctic. This unique work  done in  collaboration between the Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic and the Arctic states    is what makes the Arctic Council so valuable.  To ensure the maintenance of robust governance in the Arctic—governance that is  capable of tackling the increasing challenges and opportunities the region is facing— cooperation must continue at the Arctic Council. Canada must also identify new forums  and leverage existing ones in new ways to advance discussions on Arctic issues. Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples must be active partners in the conduct of   international relations in the Arctic.   Arctic states also meet in other regional and international forums that contribute to  upholding the rules-based international order  including the Arctic Coast Guard Forum  and the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement. The latter came into force in 2021   establishing a precautionary 16-year ban on commercial fishing on the high seas of   the Arctic Ocean.  Arctic states also play a leading role in advancing Arctic interests in broader global  efforts through the UN system  such as the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s)  ban on heavy fuel oil in the Arctic.  An extensive international legal framework applies to the Arctic Ocean. The law of  the sea  including as set out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)   determines states’ jurisdictions and their rights and obligations in various maritime  zones. These rules apply to the delineation of the outer limits of continental shelves   navigation  the management of natural resources  the protection of the marine environ- ment and other uses of the sea. Consistent with the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration4  Canada  remains committed to the orderly settlement of Arctic disputes in accordance with  international law and expects the same of other signatories  including Russia.  4\\t\\tThe\\tIlulissat\\tDeclaration\\twas\\tsigned\\tby\\tthe\\t5\\tArctic\\tOcean\\tcoastal\\tstates\\t(Canada \\tthe\\tUnited\\tStates \\tthe\\tKingdom\\tof\\t  \\t Denmark \\tNorway\\tand\\tRussia)\\tat\\tIlulissat \\tGreenland \\tin\\tMay\\t2008.\\tIn\\tthe\\tdeclaration \\tthe\\t5\\tstates\\tpledged\\tto\\tenhance\\t  \\t their\\tscientific\\tand\\tenvironmental\\tcooperation\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tOcean.\\tThey\\talso\\tcommitted\\tto\\tthe\\torderly\\tsettlement\\tof\\t  \\t overlaps\\tin\\ttheir\\trespective\\textended\\tcontinental\\tshelves \\tin\\taccordance\\twith\\tinternational\\tlaw.  11  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Canada has a clear interest in maintaining the structures of governance in   the Arctic that ensure Canada’s central role in guiding the region’s future.   Canada especially values the Arctic Council because it provides a platform   for Indigenous Peoples to help shape circumpolar affairs. Canada will not   allow Russia to undermine  through its actions  the pillars of international   cooperation in the Arctic.

Climate     change: the    overarching    threat  Climate change is both the most pressing and the most proximate threat to Canada’s  security in the Arctic and the people who live there. Its causes and effects are not  bound by countries’ official borders.  Climate change is progressing at an alarming pace  with the Arctic warming 4 times  faster than the global average  causing significant impacts on natural and human   environments. These impacts serve as threat multipliers because changing environ- mental conditions create additional opportunities for foreign adversaries and   competitors to covertly or overtly operate in the Canadian Arctic.  The total surface area of Arctic Ocean ice is shrinking  with varied implications for  maritime shipping  trade and resource extraction across the Arctic. Maritime traffic in  the Arctic will continue to increase  which will drive further foreign interest in the region.  This includes maritime traffic in Canada’s Arctic Archipelago  despite the risks and  hazards associated with the unpredictable ice conditions.  With retreating sea ice and new technologies improving navigation and accessibility   foreign activity in the Arctic will continue to increase  bringing with it related safety   security and environmental challenges. With other Arctic states  Canada must be  prepared to respond.  Climate change is also driving an increase in climate-related emergencies and   disrupting ecosystems that Arctic communities rely on for their livelihoods  with   significant implications for the security of northerners  including Indigenous Peoples   who are disproportionately affected by these changes.  Northerners  including Indigenous Peoples  have shared concerns about climate  change and their ongoing efforts to improve their resiliency in the face of increased  pressures on communities and livelihoods  food security and the destabilization of  critical and civilian infrastructure. The disappearance of year-round ice cover and  changes in the timing and durability of the floe edge; increasing subsidence due to  permafrost thaw; and a greater frequency and severity of wildfires are examples of the  impacts of climate change on Arctic communities  all of which have both material and  psychological impacts.  For instance  communities in the North are often impacted by major wildfires. In 2023   more than half of the population of the Northwest Territories had to be evacuated.   There is an ongoing need to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change in the  Arctic to reduce vulnerabilities. Canada must support Arctic and northern Indigenous  Peoples and other northerners in adapting to the environment as it is and will be—not  as one wishes it would be.   In parallel  climate change is driving interest in the Arctic as a sustainable and reliable  source of critical minerals  such as lithium  graphite  nickel  cobalt  copper and rare  earth elements integral to the transition to a low-carbon economy. For Canada and  its allies  the Arctic’s resource potential provides an opportunity to diversify critical  mineral production in partnership with territorial and provincial governments  Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples and local communities. This must be done carefully   respecting the livelihoods of local communities.   Climate change is a global problem; it requires global solutions and multilateral collaboration.  13  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 5.  Increasing     challenges to    Arctic states’    primacy  Canada’s approach to the Arctic is guided by the fundamental principle that the Arctic  should be governed by the Arctic states in collaboration with Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples. As in other regions  strategic competition in the Arctic is growing   with non-Arctic states and actors increasingly expressing foreign policy or security  aspirations  thereby pushing for greater roles in Arctic affairs.  Since 2019  there has been a growing narrative among some non-Arctic states that  they should have a greater say in Arctic governance. China  in particular  has expressed  an ambition to become a “polar great power ” by 2030.  Among China’s priorities in the Arctic are developing commercial shipping opportuni- ties  including a “Polar Silk Road ” as well as natural resource exploitation  including of  critical minerals  oil and gas and fish. China is also active in Arctic research  much   of which can be considered dual use.  China seeks to shape the international order into a more permissive environment for  interests and values that increasingly deviate from Canada’s commitment to a rules- based international system. China can be expected to use all the tools at its disposal   to advance its geopolitical interests  including in the Arctic. Canada will challenge China  when it ought to and cooperate when its interests align with China’s.  China  like all states  has rights and responsibilities related to its use of the world’s  oceans that apply equally in the Arctic. For example  in accordance with UNCLOS   China can only conduct marine scientific research in the exclusive economic zone  of another state with the consent of that state. Canada will carefully review any such  requests related to its own exclusive economic zone and provide or withhold consent  consistent with the provisions of the convention.  14  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   Photo Credit: © Global Affairs  Canada  Consistent with its Indo-Pacific Strategy and in collaboration with partners  Canada will  always act on matters of Arctic governance to protect national and northern interests   including when dealing with China. Canada will cooperate with China to address   pressing global issues—such as climate change—that have impacts on the Arctic.  In the Canadian Arctic  Canada will always work to protect Canada’s economic security   safeguard Canadian values and protect Canadians from malign influence.  Canada will continue to work closely with the United States to counter all forms   of malign influence and activity in the North American Arctic.   In the wider region  Canada will always uphold the founding principles that under- pinned the Ottawa Declaration in 1996 on the establishment of the Arctic Council.  These include Canada’s commitment to the well-being of the inhabitants of the Arctic;  its commitment to sustainable development in the Arctic region  including economic  and social development  improved health conditions and cultural well-being; its   commitment to the protection of the Arctic environment; and its commitment to  ensure full consultation with  and the involvement of  Indigenous Peoples and their   communities and other inhabitants of the Arctic on Arctic Council activities.  At all times  Canada’s engagement in the Arctic will be focused first and foremost on  promoting and defending Canadian national interests. Canada will adopt a pragmatic  approach when circumstances require it.  15  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ARCTIC FOREIGN  POLICY PILLARS  The Arctic Foreign Policy provides Global Affairs Canada  with additional diplomatic tools to support a stable   prosperous and secure Arctic and to fully implement   the objectives laid out in the International chapter of   the ANPF given the changing geopolitical context.  We will do this by continuing to assert Canada’s   sovereignty; advancing Canada’s national interests  through pragmatic diplomacy; leading on Arctic   governance and multilateral challenges; and adopting   a more inclusive approach to Arctic diplomacy.

Leveraging diplomacy to support national defence and security  The Government of Canada will continue to take a   comprehensive approach to Arctic security by prioritizing  the security  interests and priorities of the Arctic region  and northerners  as well as Canadians more broadly.  Canada’s foreign and defence policies are closely  intertwined and complementary. Effective diplomacy  is critical for shaping the international environment to  defend and advance Canadian national interests; it is   a first line of defence for Canada’s national security.   Canada’s fundamental defence and security goal is   to prevent and defuse potential crises before they can  develop into conflict.  Canada’s national security is also supported by human  security. Strong and resilient local communities are vital  to national defence.  Canada engages in the Arctic from a position of strength  thanks to the Canadian Armed Forces’ (CAF’s) presence  and capabilities  exercises and operations  including  those of the Canadian Rangers. Canadian Rangers are  active  well-respected members of their communities   and they play a critical role in demonstrating Canadian  sovereignty over the lands  waters and ice of Canada’s  North and Arctic.  Building on the NORAD modernization investments  announced in 2022  Canada’s defence policy update  Our North  Strong and Free identified the Government of  Canada’s most pressing priority as the continued asser- tion of Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and northern  regions. Canada is making investments to ensure that  the CAF has the capabilities required to operate in an  evolving geopolitical context. By 2030  Canada will have  almost tripled its defence spending from 2015.  Strengthened military capabilities will bolster the CAF’s  ability to conduct and sustain operations in the Arctic  and create opportunities for strengthened collaboration  with allies and partners. Canada regularly invites select  allies and partners to take part in Operation NANOOK   the CAF’s signature northern operation series. Canada  also works with allies and partners on multinational  research and development activities relevant to the  conduct of defence and security operations in   the polar regions.   In addition to NORAD modernization and the defence  policy update  Canada is pursuing historic investments  to increase its military capability in the maritime domain  in the Arctic. Ensuring that Canada’s internal waters in  the Arctic are well defended is a critical component of  maintaining a secure North American homeland. Canada  will maintain strong defence capabilities in its internal  Arctic waters  including in the Northwest Passage.   17  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Here is a summary of key defence   and security investments:    Several military capabilities will play a key role in   exercising Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and  northern waters  including Canada’s 6 new Arctic  Offshore Patrol Ships; up to 15 new River Class  Destroyers; 11 new MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones;   up to 16 new P-8A Poseidon multi-mission aircraft  specialized in anti-submarine and anti-surface  warfare; and 88 new F-35A fighter aircraft.     Canada’s $38.6 billion plan to modernize NORAD will  significantly enhance domain awareness in the Arctic  and the North through the establishment of a   new northern approaches surveillance system to   complement the North Warning System and further   investment in space-based surveillance. It also  includes further investment in space-based polar  communications; additional air-to-air refuelling aircraft  to support and extend the reach of CAF operations— and NORAD operations—in Canada; additional and  longer-range air-to-air missiles for Canada’s fighter  fleet; significant infrastructure upgrades at airfields  used to support NORAD forward operations; and   more than $4 billion in new funding for science   and technology.    The defence policy update announced an additional  $8.1 billion in spending over the next 5 years and   $73 billion over the next 20 years to support   Canada’s national defence and security in the Arctic.  This includes a new fleet of airborne early warning  and control aircraft; specialized maritime sensors   including some that can be deployed by Harry  DeWolf-class Arctic Offshore Patrol vessels; a new  fleet of tactical helicopters; and a new satellite  ground station in the Arctic to enhance the use of  Canadian  U.S. and other Allied space capabilities.     The defence policy update will also establish a new  network of Northern Operational Support Hubs to  further enhance the CAF’s presence  responsiveness  and partnerships across the Arctic and the North  and invest in multi-use infrastructure that also meets  the needs of the territories  Indigenous Peoples and  northern communities.    In July 2024  Canada announced it would initiate new  spending programs to put the country on track to  reach NATO’s target of 2% of GDP spending by 2032.  This will include the purchase of up to 12 convention- ally powered  under-ice-capable submarines by the  Royal Canadian Navy.    In 2024  the Government of Canada initiated the   procurement of 8 new icebreakers made in Canada  to support Canadian Coast Guard operations in the  Arctic  including 2 polar icebreakers that will enable  year-round icebreaker presence in the Arctic. The  icebreakers will contribute to the protection of the  marine environment  the resupplying of communities  and the collection of data that enhances Canada’s  maritime domain awareness in support of maritime  safety and security  climate resilience and   scientific research.    In July 2024  Canada  the United States and Finland   announced an enhanced trilateral partnership called  the ICE Pact. It is a collaborative effort to build best- in-class Arctic and polar icebreakers and other Arctic  and polar capabilities in each of the countries by  sharing expertise  information and capabilities. This  partnership also bolsters the ability of like-minded  nations to uphold international rules  norms and  standards to ensure safety and to sustain peace and  stability in the Arctic.  The diplomatic initiatives in the Arctic Foreign Policy will  complement all of these investments by better aligning  Canada’s strategic approaches and by strengthening  its relationships with its Arctic allies  with territorial and  provincial governments and with Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners.  18  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy i.  Bridging the intelligence gap  To address the complex range of threats faced in the  Arctic  Canada must conceptualize security not only in  military terms. Security in the Arctic includes community  security  research security  economic security  security  against disinformation and any other form of interference  and physical and digital infrastructure security.  We will work with Public Safety Canada to support efforts  to strengthen Canadian national resilience to counter  malign influence and activities of foreign powers. Canada  will strengthen the defence of its critical infrastructure  across the country  including in the Arctic  to protect  northern communities against foreign interference. This  can be achieved through the Investment Canada Act;  by strengthening Canadian cyber security systems; and  through new legislation to address foreign interference.  We will provide relevant territorial   provincial and Indigenous  governments with regular briefings  and information on emerging and  developing international security  trends  including threats affecting the  Arctic  to ensure that they are equipped  to support communities in Canada’s  Arctic and North and to make informed  decisions about the security of their  communities.  This will be achieved in collaboration  with the Canadian Security Intelligence  Service  the Communications Security  Establishment  the Department of  National Defence and Public   Safety Canada.

Global Affairs Canada will support the  work of Innovation  Science and Economic  Development Canada  Crown-Indigenous  Relations and Northern Affairs and its  portfolio agencies  the Department of  National Defence  Natural Resources  Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada   among others  to support the scientific  research permitting process in the Arctic   particularly for international applicants  undertaking research that can be  considered dual use.  To help ensure emerging challenges  concerning research security and science  collaboration in the North are addressed    we will help by increasing our capacity  to learn about concerns from those on  the ground  holding annual round-table  meetings on science and research relating  to Canada’s Arctic foreign policy priorities.  We will work closely with other federal  government departments and agencies   to organize the round-table meetings.  The Arctic ambassador (see Pillar 4 -  Adopting a more inclusive approach to  Arctic diplomacy) will work with Indigenous  Peoples and partners from territorial and  provincial governments  as well as across  the Government of Canada  to contribute  to the efforts to address climate change   biodiversity and other areas where  Indigenous Knowledge  science and  technologies could contribute solutions   to the challenges in the Arctic.  The Arctic ambassador will also work with  Canada’s Chief Science Advisor on issues  related to science and research.  20  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  ii.  Strengthening research security  International scientific collaboration plays an important  role in addressing gaps in knowledge of the Arctic  region  including in relation to climate change. The last  20 years have seen a marked increase in international  research activity across the Canadian and   circumpolar Arctic.   While Canada continues to welcome scientific   collaboration in the Arctic  Canada’s oversight  regu- latory  safety and security bodies must be equipped  to address potential threats and harms at all levels. In  particular  Canada must guard against foreign research  in the Canadian Arctic and North that is dual use—having  both research and military application.   This requires balancing between the important priority  of advancing recognized areas of needed international  scientific collaboration  such as climate change research   with necessary due diligence to protect Canada’s most  sensitive research.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy iii. Partnering with the Canadian Coast Guard      to support defence and security  The Canadian Coast Guard  alongside other partner  departments and agencies  is responsible for maritime  domain awareness and plays a critical role in supporting  the defence and security of the North.  Building on the Canadian Coast Guard Arctic Strategy   released in 2024  the Canadian Coast Guard will continue  to contribute to Canada’s national security  including  through its assistance to Arctic scientific   research expeditions.  The Canadian Coast Guard currently operates up to   6 icebreakers in the Arctic from June to November each  year  which helps advance maritime safety and security.  In the coming years  the Canadian Coast Guard will  acquire 8 new icebreakers  including 2 polar icebreakers  that will provide capacity for year-round presence   in the Arctic.  The Canadian Coast Guard also helps to deepen  Canadian defence cooperation with Arctic allies through  Operation Pacer Goose. The annual operation resupplies  the United States’ Pituffik Space Base (formerly known  as Thule Air Base) in Greenland  ensuring that essential  supplies are safely delivered in challenging   Arctic conditions.  To strengthen the interconnections  between the Arctic Foreign Policy  and the Canadian Coast Guard Arctic  Strategy  we will collaborate more  closely with the Canadian Coast  Guard to leverage its maritime  domain expertise and support its  work with international partners.  Through its operations and activities   the Canadian Coast Guard helps  contribute to stronger relationships with  Canada’s Arctic allies. Through deeper  collaboration  the Canadian Coast  Guard will also be able to expand its  partnerships with regional coast guards  from like-minded states.   21  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy iv. Strengthening regional defence      and security architectures  To respond to the evolving threat landscape in the Arctic   Canada will strengthen coordination and dialogue with  Arctic allies on security issues.  Alongside the Department of National Defence  we  will increase our information sharing with NATO on  circumpolar threats. We will improve interoperability and  increase the collective understanding of the evolving  security situation in the Arctic and enhance the Alliance’s  cold-weather capabilities. Canada will continue to be  an active participant in NATO exercises and operations   including in the European High North.  To ensure seamless situational awareness and informa- tion sharing on northern threats that do not recognize  borders or military command areas of responsibility   Canada supports greater coordination and collaboration  between the military forces of like-minded Arctic states   including in the context of NATO and NORAD activities.  Canada will explore and foster new partnerships to  strengthen the strategic resilience of the North American  Arctic  particularly with Alaska  the Yukon  the Northwest  Territories  Nunavut and Greenland.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  To complement existing defence forums  Canada is exploring opportunities to deepen  security dialogue among all like-minded states in the Arctic  including through regular  security discussions.    Canada will initiate an Arctic security dialogue with the ministers of foreign affairs of  like-minded states in the Arctic. Discussions will focus on sharing information on  and  on analyses of  issues relating to international Arctic relations and security; as well  as discussing national approaches to cross-cutting security challenges; advancing  opportunities for collaboration; and increasing collective resilience.  22  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Upholding the rules-based international order  The waters of Canada’s Arctic Archipelago  including   the various channels comprising the Northwest Passage   are internal waters of Canada by virtue of historic title  and in accordance with international law. Canada’s Arctic  sovereignty encompasses land  sea and ice. It extends  without interruption to the seaward-facing coasts of the  Arctic islands and beyond. These islands are joined  not  divided  by the waters between them and are bridged for  a large part of the year by ice.  Indigenous Peoples in Canada have used and occupied  the ice and waters as they have used and occupied  the lands for thousands of years. Every day  through a  wide range of activities  Arctic and northern Indigenous  Peoples and governments  as well as territorial and  provincial governments and other northerners  share  stewardship over the Arctic lands and waters of Canada.  It is through the reciprocal recognition of each other’s  mutual interests in these lands and waters that Canada  and Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples share in the  stewardship of them—further codified in modern treaties  and self-government agreements. Sovereignty and   sovereign rights in the Arctic are inextricably linked   to issues of Indigenous self-government. Canada   possesses environmental  economic  cultural and   historical interests unique to the region  the reality  and importance of which are clearly evidenced by  long-standing usage.  Canada will work with Arctic and  northern Indigenous partners to assert  shared interests and priorities in the  region  such as through partnerships  with the Inuit Marine Monitoring  Program and the Indigenous  Guardians program.5 These initiatives  provide Indigenous Peoples with  greater opportunities to exercise  responsibility for the stewardship of  their traditional lands  waters and ice.  Canada intends to continue to act as a responsible  sovereign of its Arctic territories and waters  relying on  the rules-based international order and supported by  historical and scientific evidence. Canada’s commitment  to ensuring that maritime claims are addressed in a  manner that is consistent with international law is one   of its key enduring priorities in the Arctic.

Managing Arctic boundaries through    a rules-based approach  At a time when the rules-based international order   is under unprecedented threat  it is critical that states  resolve their disputes responsibly  through dialogue  and negotiation. Canada has made resolving boundary  disputes in accordance with international law one of the  foundational principles of its foreign policy in the Arctic.  Enhanced international cooperation on maritime  boundaries also helps secure states’ respective national  interests over their resources  including energy  minerals   fish and wildlife.  Canada will advance efforts to resolve  Arctic boundary disputes peacefully  and in accordance with international  law  including UNCLOS  and in  consultation with Indigenous partners   particularly where these international  boundaries may affect treaty rights.  Canada–Kingdom of Denmark  boundary agreement  Canada  the Kingdom of Denmark  and  Greenland have resolved the maritime  boundary and long-time dispute over  Tartupaluk. In June 2022  following  5 years of intensive negotiations   the Canadian  Nunavut  Danish and  Greenlandic governments agreed  on a modernized single maritime  boundary  from the Lincoln Sea in  the north to the Labrador Sea in  the south—a distance of over 3 000  kilometres—which established the  longest bilateral maritime boundary  in the world. The agreement also  resolved the overlap in our respective  continental shelves in the Labrador Sea.  With the Kingdom of Denmark   Canada agreed to divide the island  of Tartupaluk roughly in half; Canada  is now advancing discussions on an  agreed border regime for Tartupaluk   which requires engagement with the  Government of Nunavut and local  Inuit communities. This is the last step  before the agreement can come into  force  which Canada is committed to  completing in the near future.  24  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Extended continental shelf  Canada–United States   Beaufort Sea boundary  In September 2024  Canada launched  negotiations with the United States to  resolve the 2 countries’ long-standing  maritime boundary dispute in the  Beaufort Sea. The area in question  is north of the Yukon and Alaska and  measures approximately 270 000  square kilometres. Both countries claim  jurisdiction over the disputed region  by way of differing legal interpretations  of the 1825 treaty between Russia and  Great Britain.  Reflecting the Government of Canada’s  commitment to partnership and  reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples   the boundary negotiations will involve  impacted Inuit Treaty Organizations and  close consultations with territorial and  Indigenous governments.   In December 2022  Canada filed  an addendum to its Arctic Ocean  extended continental shelf  submission with the Commission on  the Limits of the Continental Shelf  in response to Russia’s addendum   which was filed in March 2021. Russia’s  addendum greatly expanded the size  of the continental shelf included in its  submission and tripled the area that  overlaps with Canada’s own continental  shelf. Canada’s 2022 addendum  rebalanced the overlap area.  In December 2023  the United  States published the outer limits  of its extended continental shelf  in the western Arctic Ocean. This  announcement offers an opportunity  for Canada to renew negotiations  with the United States regarding the  overlap of the countries’ respective  continental shelves. These discussions  are expected to begin in late 2024.  Canada  like all Arctic Ocean coastal  states  remains committed to settling  continental shelf overlap areas  peacefully and in accordance   with international law.  25  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Advancing Canada’s interests   through pragmatic diplomacy  A fundamental principle of Canadian foreign policy is that the Arctic   should be governed by the Arctic states. This has long been a shared   principle of the Arctic states and has produced a long period    of peaceful cooperation and development in the region.   1. Strengthening Canada’s partnerships with Arctic allies  i.  The United States   The United States is Canada’s closest partner and ally   in the Arctic  and this collaboration extends across many  shared interests. Collaboration is advanced by Canada’s  extensive diplomatic network of 13 missions across the  United States and through various bilateral mechanisms.  With the United States  Canada shares a unique   relationship shaped by geography  history  shared values   common interests and strong people-to-people connec- tions. This is especially the case in the Arctic  particularly  among Indigenous Peoples  whose history  culture and  connections transcend national borders.   The Canada–United States defence partnership is  essential to maintaining a secure North American   homeland. Canada welcomes the continued partici- pation of the United States’ military and coast guard in  Canada-led exercises and operations in Canada’s   Arctic and North.  Going forward  Canada will continue to advance bilateral cooperation with the United  States in the North at all levels of government in existing areas of importance and explore  new avenues of cooperation in critical areas of national interest  including: security and  safety; the defence of North America; science and research technology; energy security;  supply chains; climate change; critical minerals; sustainable development; Indigenous  cross-border mobility; economic development; marine and terrestrial conservation; and the  protection of transboundary species  including salmon and the Porcupine caribou herd.  26  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii.   The Nordic states  Canada maintains close relations with its Nordic Arctic  neighbours; specifically  the Kingdom of Denmark  (consisting of Denmark  Greenland and the Faroe  Islands)  Finland  Iceland  Norway and Sweden. These  close relationships are underpinned by shared values   a common outlook on the world and a shared commit- ment to ensuring a peaceful and stable Arctic through  the enduring success of NATO. They continue to grow  stronger  with a particularly marked increase in dialogue  and cooperation since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now  more than ever  it is critical for Canada to have strong  partnerships with the Nordic states  as Canada and they  are all now members of NATO and Russia’s actions have  complicated cooperation in multilateral spaces of Arctic  governance. Examples of Canada’s close relationships  with its Nordic Arctic neighbours include the following:    In 2022  Canada was the first country to ratify    the accessions of Finland and Sweden to NATO.    In June 2023  Canada’s prime minister was the  invited guest at the Nordic prime ministers’   annual meeting  in Iceland.    In June 2024  the Government of Canada committed  up to $20 million in funding for an international  research initiative on the sustainable development  of the Arctic in collaboration with NordForsk  an   organization under the Nordic Council of Ministers.  It will support collaborative and multi-disciplinary  scientific efforts and contributions from across the  Arctic region and include Indigenous perspectives.    In September 2024  Canada’s minister of foreign affairs  and the premier of Nunavut co-hosted representa- tives from the Kingdom of Denmark  Finland  Iceland   Norway and Sweden for the first Canada-Nordic  Strategic Dialogue  in Iqaluit  Nunavut.    Canada is committed to deepening its partnership  with the Nordic countries as friends and allies with  common values and shared stewardship over the Arctic.  Strengthening Canada’s cooperation will also help it  respond to new threats and below-threshold activities by  its adversaries in both the North American Arctic and the  European High North.   Working in collaboration with other  federal departments  we will increase  our support for bilateral and regional  cooperation with the Kingdom of  Denmark  Finland  Iceland  Norway  and Sweden in Arctic science and  technology  climate change  culture   Indigenous-to-Indigenous ties  natural  resources  sustainable development  through trade and infrastructure and  defence and security.  We will also create a new position  in one of Canada’s Nordic missions  with responsibility for increasing  coordination and information sharing   including on security issues    with Nordic partners.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  27  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy To do this  we will open new consulates in Anchorage   Alaska  and Nuuk  Greenland.  Alaska is a key partner on a range of issues  including  border security and crossings  security and defence in  the Arctic  climate resilience and conservation  energy  security  critical minerals and Indigenous affairs.   Members of the CAF are stationed in Alaska to support  the NORAD mission and work alongside their U.S. military  counterparts in the defence of North America.  In addition  the Yukon also has mature and close-knit  bilateral relations with Alaska from both a political and  trade perspective.   iii. The North American Arctic: Alaska and Greenland  The North American Arctic encompasses the vast   northern territories of 3 countries: Alaska (the United  States) in the west; northern Canada in the centre;   and Greenland (the Kingdom of Denmark) in the east.   The relationships in this region are unique due to   geographical proximity and the ancestral relations   that exist between Indigenous Peoples  which give rise   to a number of shared interests  including on security   defence  climate change  sustainable development   critical minerals  trade  culture and Indigenous mobility.  The ANPF emphasizes increasing cooperation among  federal  territorial  provincial and Indigenous govern- ments and other organizations in and across the   Canadian Arctic and with Canada’s North American   Arctic partners.  The Arctic Foreign Policy complements this by  re-emphasizing the importance of deepening Canada’s  diplomatic engagement with its neighbours  the United  States  including Alaska  and the Kingdom of Denmark   including Greenland. This will make the Canadian and  North American Arctic more secure and create new  opportunities for economic cooperation  scientific   collaboration and cultural exchange.   The consulate in Anchorage will help promote trade and  economic ties between Canada’s territories and provinces and  Alaska; improve security and defence partnerships; strengthen  collaboration on environmental and wildlife issues; engage with  Alaskan communities  including Indigenous communities; and  support cross-border people-to-people ties.   28  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Many ties  both formal and informal  have been forged  over the years at all levels of government and between  Inuit organizations in Canada and Greenland. Several  bilateral initiatives have been advanced in recent years   including the Letter of Intent for Cooperation on the  Pikialasorsuaq (2023) and the Memorandum of Under- standing between the Government of Greenland and the  Government of Nunavut (2022). However  cooperation to  date has largely occurred organically  without an   overarching foreign policy framework.  In recognition of the growing importance of Greenland   as a key Arctic partner  a more coordinated approach  with Greenland  including with the government of   Nunavut  is a priority in ensuring that Canadian   interests are being advanced effectively.  The consulate in Nuuk will be a  valuable resource for coordinating  and advancing Canadian interests in  Greenland  enhancing bilateral and  commercial relations  facilitating  research collaboration and supporting  increased engagement and  collaboration across many   policy spaces.  We welcome Greenland’s  commitment to open a  representational office in Canada.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  29  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Holding    Russia    accountable  Russia represents a generational geopolitical challenge.  Although Russia accounts for 50% of the Arctic   geographically  bilateral cooperation between Canada  and Russia  including in the Arctic  will remain   exceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future.  Canada will continue to hold Russia accountable in regional  and multilateral forums for its actions and counter disinformation  promoted by the Russian regime  including through Canada’s  leadership of the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism. This includes  countering disinformation targeting communities   in the Canadian Arctic.   Alongside allies and partners  Canada will continue confronting  Russian aggression  including through Canada’s enduring   support for Ukraine  and by continuing to meet NATO   defence commitments.  Together with the United States  Canada will defend NATO’s  western flank  and with Arctic allies  Canada will defend NATO’s  northern regions and approaches.  Canada acknowledges that the actions of the Putin  regime do not always reflect the values of the Russian  people. This policy clearly differentiates between   government actions and those of the broader Russian  population  including its Indigenous Peoples  who them- selves have been marginalized by the Russian regime.  Across all multilateral bodies  Canada will maintain its  policy of limited engagement with Russian officials.  It is for Russia to create the conditions that will enable  a return to political engagement and cooperation by  ending its war in Ukraine and acting in accordance   with international law.  30  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   3.  Pragmatic    diplomacy    with non-    Arctic states    and actors  While Canada will continue to prioritize cooperation   with Arctic states  especially when it comes to setting  the rules that govern the region  cooperation with a  wider set of actors is beneficial and necessary to address  challenges to the Arctic emanating from global issues   such as climate change.  Given the prospect of growing competition in the Arctic   Canada will be strategic in prioritizing pragmatic   cooperation with non-Arctic states and actors that   align with Canadian values  interests and objectives.  Canada will be guided by the following principles:   › Respect for Arctic states’ sovereignty  sovereign rights and    jurisdiction in the Arctic.   › Support for the rules-based international order in the Arctic    and a demonstrated commitment to regional peace and stability.   › Respect for Indigenous self-determination  Indigenous rights and the values    interests  cultures and traditions of Arctic Indigenous Peoples  including the   participation of Indigenous Peoples in Arctic decision making  and other   Arctic inhabitants.   › Respect for the extensive legal framework that applies to the Arctic Ocean     including UNCLOS.   › Recognition of interests and expertise that are relevant to  and aligned with     Canada’s Arctic and northern priorities  as well as its national defence   and security interests.   › Maintaining a commitment to uphold and advance democratic values    human rights and gender equality according to international standards    regulations and principles.   › Openness with regard to scientific data sharing and collaboration   with Canadian researchers and local communities  including their   representative governments.   › Commitment to sustainable development  conservation  environmental    protection and fighting climate change.   Engagement with non-Arctic states and actors will be  channeled through a variety of multilateral forums  such  as the Arctic Council  appropriate UN bodies  NATO and  the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable  as well as treaties  that apply to the Arctic  such as the Central Arctic Ocean  Fisheries Agreement  and bilateral and multilateral   platforms and projects that we will drive with other  federal departments and agencies.  Going forward  based on the above principles  Canada  will place particular emphasis on cooperation with  non-Arctic states and actors in 2 regions: the North  Atlantic and the North Pacific.  31  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy The North Atlantic  Canada will strengthen engagement  on Arctic matters with the European  Union  the United Kingdom and other  key North Atlantic states through  established mechanisms  such as the  Canada–European Union Strategic  Partnership Agreement. Science   technology and innovation will remain  the focus of Canada’s cooperation with  the European Union and key European  states through Canada’s engagement  on the European Union–United  States–Canada Arctic Working Group  of the All-Atlantic Ocean Research  and Innovation Alliance; the Canada- European Union Ocean Partnership  Forum; and the Horizon   Europe program.  Other priorities for Arctic cooperation include facilitating  the mobility of Inuit between Canada and Greenland;  facilitating the trade of  and access to  the seal products  of Inuit and other Indigenous Peoples  in the E.U. market;  the conservation of fish stocks through the Canada– European Union High-Level Dialogue on Fisheries;   environmental protection; climate mitigation and   adaptation; trade and sustainable economic   development; security cooperation through   high-level dialogues; and the Canada–European   Union Green Alliance.  The United Kingdom is another close partner in the  North Atlantic based on Canada’s deep partnership   with the country and their historic ties and shared values.  The 2 countries enjoy a close-knit defence partnership   and they cooperate on shared priorities in the Arctic   including on climate change and research through   the Canada–Inuit Nunangat–United Kingdom Arctic   Research Programme.    Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  32  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy The\\tNorth\\tPacific  Canada’s Indo-Pacific Strategy recognizes that several  Indo-Pacific states are looking to the Arctic as a region  of opportunity and as a means through which to engage  with Canada.  The strategy recognizes the North Pacific as part of  Canada’s neighbourhood. The North Pacific  through  the Bering Strait  is one of the key approaches to the  North American Arctic. Canada must not undervalue the  strategic importance of these approaches—Canada’s  adversaries do not underestimate them. In line with the  strategy  Canada will explore ways to deepen Arctic  cooperation with key North Pacific states on issues of  mutual interest while also responding to the emerging  challenges some may represent.  While Canada is pleased to engage with Indo-Pacific  states making positive contributions in the Arctic accord- ing to the principles for engagement with non-Arctic  states  Canada will closely scrutinize activities of states  whose ambitions or activities are potentially counter to  Canadian values  interests or objectives in the region.  In addition to Canada’s long-standing partnership with the  United States on Arctic issues  focus will be given to increasing  cooperation with other key partners in the region—Japan and the  Republic of Korea—given the mutual long-standing relationships  and shared values of the 3 nations.  Canada will work through established forums and mechanisms   such as the Arctic Council  the Canada-Japan Action Plan for  Contributing to a Free and Open Indo-Pacific Region and the  Canada-Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership  to identify  concrete opportunities to deepen cooperation between the   4 countries on shared priorities  such as maritime security   science and technology  trade and sustainable economic   development and fisheries.  33  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Leadership on Arctic governance  and multilateral challenges  Despite\\texceedingly\\tdifficult\\trelations\\twith\\tRussia \\tArctic\\tstates\\t  continue to preside over a well-governed region operating under   extensive national and international legal frameworks.

Reinforcing      the Arctic    Council  Canada is firmly committed to the enduring value of the  Arctic Council and is adhering to its established Rules  of Procedure. Canada remains focused on continuing  the council’s important work for the benefit of the Arctic  region and the people living there  including   Indigenous Peoples.    Since 2021  our Global Arctic Leadership Initiative has  funded the establishment of a permanent secretariat  of the Arctic Council’s Sustainable Development   Working Group in Canada and provided over $2 million  in funding for more than 25 Arctic Council initiatives  with national  civil society and Indigenous partners.   The Arctic Council exists thanks in part to Canadian and  Indigenous leadership. Canada will not allow Russia’s  actions to undermine the integrity or functionality of this  important body. The people of the Arctic  who benefit so  deeply from the important work of the council  should  not be made to suffer because of Russia’s choices.     We will increase our contributions to the Arctic Council to allow for more Canadian  engagement and leadership in council projects and greater institutional support for the  council  as well as provide funding for innovative Indigenous and youth ideas in the council.  This support is critically important as the council continues to increase its activities.  Canada will increase its leadership in the council in preparation for Canada’s third chairship  of the Arctic Council  from 2029 to 2031. Working with Canadian and Arctic Council  partners  Canada will meaningfully engage the Permanent Participants from Canada   territorial and provincial governments of Canada and other Indigenous partners on the  planning and development of Canada’s Arctic Council chairship program.   Those essential building blocks will also provide guidance on how Canada engages in  other international polar processes  such as the International Polar Year: 2032 to 2033  which  is an opportunity to showcase Canada’s leadership through scientific and technological  achievements  as well as by amplifying Indigenous Peoples’ voices and   their rich knowledge.  35  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Addressing regional     and global challenges  i.  Climate change and environmental protection  While the triple crisis of climate change  biodiversity   loss and pollution is a global problem that requires  urgent collective action  the impacts of this triple crisis  are disproportionately felt by northerners. Canada has  taken a dual-track approach to addressing these issues   with engagement at the multilateral level through the  UN system and at the regional level through   the Arctic Council.  In addition to robust domestic measures to address  climate change  Canada is also working with international  partners to boost global efforts to achieve the Paris  Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C to avoid   the most devastating impacts for the world    including the Arctic.  Cutting emissions of black carbon is the most powerful  action to take to slow the pace of near-term warming in  the Arctic. For this reason  Arctic states agreed to   collectively reduce emissions of black carbon by 25%   to 33% of 2013 levels by 2025. Canada is on track to do   its part in achieving this collective goal.  Canada is also doing its part to address biodiversity loss  and advance conservation domestically and globally.  Canada continues to work toward conserving 30%   of its lands and oceans by 2030. A large part of   Canada’s protected and conserved areas fall within   Canada’s Arctic and North  and many are being   co-managed with Indigenous Peoples.6   To increase cohesiveness  we will continue to leverage  our diplomatic resources in support of all government  efforts led by Environment and Climate Change  Canada in the UN system to ensure implementation  of the historic Paris Agreement  of the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change  and of the  Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework  under the Convention on Biological Diversity.

The ambassador will also continue to promote any other diplomatic  initiatives that address climate change. The Arctic ambassador will support this work.  Additionally  in the context of the Arctic Council’s initiatives on climate change  Canada will  continue its ongoing work at a regional level to develop scientific assessments on the  impacts of climate change and the state of biodiversity in the Arctic; to reduce short-lived  climate pollutants in the Arctic region; to encourage the use and development of renewable  energy in remote Arctic communities to exchange knowledge and implement solutions  on wildfires and climate change adaptation in an Arctic context; to develop a pan-Arctic  network of marine protected areas; and to implement the regional action plan on marine  litter in the Arctic.  Elsewhere  we will encourage all allies to join NATO’s Climate Change and Security  Centre of Excellence  which is based in Montréal. Working with the Department of  National Defence  we will also leverage the centre’s expertise to promote research and  knowledge sharing on climate security threats in the Arctic and elsewhere.

This  imposes a responsibility on Canada to ensure that the  area is well managed. Canada is collaborating closely  with fellow Arctic Ocean coastal states and other   interested parties to implement the Central Arctic Ocean  Fisheries Agreement  which established a precautionary  16-year ban on commercial fishing on the high seas of  the Arctic Ocean  as well as a program for joint scientific  research and monitoring that includes Indigenous  Knowledge as a vital component to ensure that the best  available knowledge is used in decision making. Canada  is also ensuring that Inuit in Canada continue to be part  of this process.  Canada is also prioritizing the protection of the marine  environment in the Arctic Ocean in cooperation with  its like-minded international and Indigenous partners.  Canada maintains an indefinite moratorium on offshore  oil and gas development in its Arctic waters. Canada  also supports  in the absence of both a comprehensive  understanding of seabed mining’s environmental  impacts and a robust regulatory regime  a moratorium  on commercial seabed mining in areas beyond national  jurisdiction  including in the central Arctic Ocean.  Canada is committed to reinforcing rules-based  approaches in the Arctic Ocean.  We will work with other departments and agencies   to continue to develop and implement international  measures to promote safe and responsible shipping  in the Arctic  including by supporting efforts at the IMO  and the Arctic Council that complement the International  Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (known as the  “Polar Code”) and the ban on heavy fuel oil   in Arctic waters.    Across all areas of Canada’s multilateral cooperation   in the UN system  at the Arctic Council and under   the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement  it is   imperative that Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples  be meaningfully engaged in discussions when their  rights or interests could be potentially impacted.  We will continue to provide funding  to Indigenous Permanent Participant  organizations in Canada to engage  in this work. We will also advocate   alongside Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples  for the equal  treatment and inclusion of Indigenous  Knowledge and science.  In support of Fisheries and Oceans  Canada  we undertake to advocate  for the development of marine  protected areas and other effective  conservation measures in the central  Arctic Ocean under the Arctic Council   thereby enabling Arctic states to lead  by example in implementing the  UN agreement on marine biological  diversity in areas beyond   national jurisdiction.  38  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Adopting a more inclusive  approach to Arctic diplomacy  1.\\tEnsuring\\tArctic\\tdiplomacy\\tis\\tinformed\\tby\\tand\\tbenefits\\tArctic\\t   and northern Indigenous Peoples and other northerners   The Arctic is home to more than 4 million people   including Indigenous Peoples who have inhabited the  region for thousands of years. Canada is committed to  a more inclusive approach to this foreign policy that  ensures people living in the North  including Indigenous  peoples  can participate in international decision making  on matters that affect their rights or interests.  Arctic diplomacy should be informed by and benefit  Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples and other  northerners. We remain committed to this goal and  will strengthen our efforts in this area  building on the  approach adopted in the ANPF to remain open to  holding discussions within more appropriate   distinctions-based frameworks  like the Inuit-Crown   Partnership Committee.   To move forward  Canada acknowledges the damaging  impacts of colonialism on the Indigenous Peoples   of Canada’s Arctic and North. Grounded in a commitment  to reconciliation  this policy seeks to build in the Arctic  foreign policy space a renewed Inuit-Crown and   nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous Peoples  based on the recognition of rights  respect  cooperation   and partnership.  Our work on this foreign policy will be guided by the  United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous  Peoples; treaties  including land claims agreements;  self-government agreements with Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples; and the Inuit Nunangat Policy.7  Canada’s Arctic foreign policy will also be guided  by respect for territorial and provincial jurisdiction   including the devolution agreements with the Northwest  Territories  Nunavut and the Yukon.  7\\t The\\tInuit\\tNunangat\\tPolicy\\trecognizes\\tInuit\\tNunangat\\tas\\ta\\tdistinct\\tgeographic \\tcultural\\tand\\tpolitical\\tregion\\tthat\\tforms\\t40%\\tof\\tCanada’s\\tland\\tarea \\t  \\t nearly\\tthree-quarters\\tof\\tits\\tcoastline\\tand\\tsignificant\\toffshore\\tareas.\\tIt\\talso\\tacknowledges\\tInuit\\tTreaty\\tOrganizations’\\tright\\tto\\trepresent\\tthemselves\\tnationally\\t  \\t and\\tinternationally\\tand\\tthat\\tstructurally\\tthey\\tmay\\tchoose\\tInuit\\tTapiriit\\tKanatami\\tand\\tthe\\tInuit\\tCircumpolar\\tCouncil\\tto\\trepresent\\tInuit\\tat\\tthe\\tnational\\t  \\t and\\tinternational\\tlevels\\trespectively.  39  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy i.  Arctic ambassador  The geopolitical landscape in the Arctic has become increasingly complex  and competitive. To ensure that the Canadian Arctic remains a region that  is stable  prosperous and secure  we need to deepen our engagement with  like-minded states  as well as with territorial and provincial governments   Indigenous Peoples and other domestic partners.  To lead this effort  we will establish the position of Arctic ambassador.  The ambassador’s responsibilities will include making linkages between domestic issues  and those relating to Canada’s foreign affairs; serving as Canada’s Senior Arctic Official and  advancing Canada’s polar interests in multilateral forums; engaging with counterparts in  Arctic and non-Arctic states  as well as with Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic; and raising  awareness internationally of Indigenous rights in the Arctic context. The ambassador will  also support the work of Global Affairs Canada and other departments on Arctic research  security.  In carrying out these duties  the ambassador will work closely with Arctic and  northern Indigenous Peoples  territorial and provincial governments and other northerners.   The ambassador will serve as a representative in our diplomatic corps and distinguish  himself or herself by ensuring that the Arctic Foreign Policy remains connected to the reality  of Canadians living in the Arctic. The ambassador will also play an important role in Canada’s  broader efforts toward reconciliation. The ambassador will have an office in Canada’s North.

Northern and Indigenous diplomacy      on the world stage  Canada remains committed to providing international  platforms for northerners  including territorial  provincial  and Indigenous partners and youths  to engage in and to  represent their own international Arctic views  especially  on issues that impact their rights or jurisdiction. Canada  also welcomes made-in-the-North initiatives to support  homegrown policy development that enhances northern  and Indigenous diplomacy on the world stage.    a. Sub-national governments  Arctic and northern public governments play a strategic  role in Canada’s Arctic diplomacy efforts. Canada  remains committed to including territorial government  officials in the Canadian delegation to Arctic   Council meetings.     b.  Arctic and northern Indigenous diplomacy  The Arctic Foreign Policy recommits to enhancing the  representation and participation of Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples in relevant negotiations and  international forums  such as the Arctic Council and the  United Nations  including the UN Permanent Forum on  Indigenous Issues  and all other bodies that Arctic and  northern Indigenous Peoples judge to affect them.  We have heard clearly from Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners that they are looking for more than  a platform where they are only one voice consulted  among many. Instead  Indigenous partners require and  demand meaningful continuous engagement to actively  partake in and shape decision making at the international  level that reflects their roles as rights holders. We will   uphold the role of Arctic and northern Indigenous   Peoples as active partners in the conduct of interna- tional relations in the Arctic and support their efforts   to advance this goal.  The Arctic Athabaskan Council  Gwich’in Council   International and the Inuit Circumpolar Council currently  sit at the Arctic Council as Permanent Participants   with membership from Canada.  Since 2020  Canada has increased funding to the   3 Permanent Participants in Canada  allowing each of  them to receive up to $650 000 each year. This support  is strengthening Indigenous voices in international Arctic  matters  particularly at the Arctic Council.  With Transport Canada  we will  support opportunities for the Inuit  Circumpolar Council Canada to  represent Inuit Knowledge and  perspectives in international forums   including on Arctic shipping and  environmental matters at the IMO.  Canada will also support similar efforts by other Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples to increase their  representation at relevant international forums to  ensure their rights and perspectives inform decision  making at the global level. Canada will work with   Indigenous partners to identify possible ways of   improving the capacity and role of Indigenous Peoples   in international Arctic affairs.   Canada remains strongly committed to the ANPF’s  objective of providing Arctic and northern youths with  additional opportunities to participate in  and benefit  from  Canada’s international Arctic agenda. We have  leveraged support for UArctic (an international network  of universities  colleges  research institutes and other  organizations concerned with education and research in  and about the Arctic) to provide opportunities for Canadi- ans to study in different parts of the circumpolar Arctic  to  generate regional solutions and to support collaboration  in Indigenous research and education.  41  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Photos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  iii. Northern and Indigenous representation      at Global Affairs Canada  Indigenous Peoples and northerners are   underrepresented at Global Affairs Canada  and   sustained efforts are needed to boost recruitment   and retention.  In line with the Future of Diplomacy  the department is  developing a new external recruitment strategy that will  be launched in 2025. The strategy will support outreach  across Canada to identify Canadians with the skills   needed to deliver on our various mandates and will  include specific outreach to under-represented   communities  including among Indigenous Peoples   and northerners.  To support our recruitment efforts and  increase Indigenous perspectives in the  department  we will establish a paid  Arctic and northern Indigenous youth  internship program that will consider  the need of Arctic and northern  Indigenous youths to remain close   to their families and communities   and ensure that appropriate support   is in place.  We will also work with partners to  identify other avenues for increasing  the representation of Indigenous  Peoples and northerners at Global  Affairs Canada.   42  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Advancing Indigenous    and northern foreign    policy priorities  Broadening Canada’s international engagement to   contribute more directly to domestic issues  such as  closing socio-economic gaps  supporting infrastructure  development  enhancing knowledge of the North    protecting the Arctic environment and advancing   reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples  remains a priority.  Key issues include those described below.  i.  Cross-border mobility  First Nations  Inuit and Métis communities in Canada’s  Arctic and North share long-standing spiritual  cultural   political  economic  social and family connections with  Indigenous communities in the United States and Green- land. The introduction of modern international borders  and the associated controls on cross-border mobility  have negatively impacted Indigenous Peoples’ ability  to maintain familial  economic and cultural ties and  traditional practices.  Photos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  Canada has been working with  Indigenous partners and the United  States  Denmark and Greenland to find  solutions to address border crossing  and migration challenges faced by First  Nations  Inuit and Métis Peoples.   This commitment is reflected in Action  Plan Measure Shared Priorities 52 of the  Action Plan to implement the United  Nations Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples Act.   To address border mobility challenges  faced by First Nations  Inuit and Métis  Peoples who live in the United States   including Alaska  Canada intends  to bring forward legislation and  regulatory measures.  43  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii.   Market access  Indigenous Peoples also face unjustifiable barriers to  trade—barriers that also restrict international market  access to Indigenous-harvested and -produced goods   such as seal fur and ivory products.  The traditional harvesting of seals and other species by  Inuit and other Indigenous Peoples of Canada is both  a sustainable and a valuable contributor to Arctic and  northern communities. Trade barriers by key partners   such as the United States  the European Union and other  countries  have a broad detrimental impact on life in  Canada’s remote Arctic and northern communities.  In August 2024  Canada submitted  a response to the European  Commission’s review of its regulation  on the trade of seal products. Canada  requested that the European Union  repeal its regulations and replace  them with rules that offer access   to ethically and sustainably   harvested products.  Canada will continue to advocate  for a repeal of the seal product ban.  We will also promote awareness of  sustainable seal products and harvest  management by hosting officials-level  dialogues with Arctic countries and  Indigenous partners at our missions   to the European Union and the   United States.

Indigenous Knowledge and participation  Canada supports Indigenous advocacy against pervasive  colonial approaches to Arctic science and research   which marginalize and discredit Indigenous Knowledge  and participation.  iv. Indigenous languages  Indigenous languages such as Inuktut8 are essential to  the preservation of Indigenous culture and the well-  being of Indigenous Peoples and communities. Canada  will therefore enhance its efforts to work with its Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners to facilitate the  exchange of knowledge and best practices related   to Indigenous language assessment  monitoring   and revitalization.  We will continue to support  equitable research partnerships  at the international level between  Indigenous and non-Indigenous  researchers  such as the Canada–Inuit  Nunangat–United Kingdom Arctic  Research Programme.  Looking forward  we will continue  to contribute to federal efforts on  a broader range of northern and  Indigenous priorities  and we will  collaborate with Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners  territorial  and provincial governments and  other northerners on international  advocacy as appropriate. This includes  promoting investment in critical  minerals development; transportation;  energy and electrification; broadband  connectivity; cultural diplomacy; and  the conservation of the Porcupine  caribou herd. We will also work with  Indigenous partners  Canadian Heritage  and other relevant government  departments to advocate for the  repatriation from across the globe of  artifacts originating from First Nations   Inuit and Métis communities.  8\\t Inuktut\\tis\\tthe\\tfirst\\tlanguage\\tused\\tin\\tInuit\\tNunaat \\tand\\tthe\\tmajority\\tof\\tInuit\\tNunaat\\tresidents\\tcontinue\\tto\\tspeak\\tInuktut\\tas\\ttheir\\tfirst \\tonly\\tor\\tpreferred\\tlanguage.\\t  \\t Therefore \\tto\\tuphold\\tthe\\tinherent\\tdignity\\tof\\tInuit \\tsupporting\\tInuktut\\tin\\tthis\\tcontext\\tas\\ta\\tfirst\\tor\\tlater\\tlanguage\\taligns\\twith\\tthe\\tbroader\\tpurposes\\tof \\tamong\\t  \\t other\\tthings \\tworking\\tin\\tpartnership\\tto\\tdemonstrate\\tand\\tpromote\\tshared\\trespect\\tfor\\tthe\\thistory\\tand\\timportance\\tof\\tInuktut\\tand\\tfor\\tsocio-economic\\t  \\t and\\tcultural\\tdevelopment.  45  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy v.   Supporting northern and Indigenous      trade and export  In line with Canada’s inclusive approach to trade and   its Export Diversification Strategy  we are committed   to supporting northern and Indigenous exporters in   accessing global markets.  The Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) recognizes that  building strong relationships with our northern and  Indigenous partners is key to this mission. Dedicated  trade commissioners  based in regional offices for British  Columbia and the Yukon; Alberta and the Northwest   Territories; Quebec and Nunavut; Manitoba and  Saskatchewan; and Atlantic Canada  work closely with  Canadian businesses in the Arctic and northern regions  to support their global expansion. The TCS network  also continues to actively support and develop tailored  programming for northern and Indigenous exporters   including through business delegations and export  training and accelerator programs  among other ways.  Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) into northern  and Indigenous communities will also play a vital role in  economic and infrastructure development in the region.  Through our increasing engagement with Northern and  Indigenous communities via the CanExport Community  Investments program  we will continue to support  municipalities and economic development organizations  in seeking and retaining FDI in the North while ensuring  that Canada’s environmental and national security   interests are protected.    3.  Transforming Global    \\tAffairs\\tCanada’s\\tdomestic\\t   engagement processes  We are committed to pursuing an ongoing collaborative  approach to domestic engagement that is informed by  early  sustained and meaningful engagement with   territorial and provincial governments  Arctic and   northern Indigenous governments and organizations   and northerners more generally.  46  The Arctic Cooperation Advisory  Committee is a Canadian forum  for the engagement of relevant  federal departments  territorial  and provincial governments and  Permanent Participant partners on the  development and implementation of  Canada’s international Arctic policy   including Arctic-Council-related  matters. It will remain an important  mechanism for dialogue and  engagement on the development and  implementation of Canada’s Arctic  Foreign Policy.   We are committed to exploring  distinctions-based engagements with  First Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty  and Self-Governing Partners from  Canada’s Arctic and North.  For example  we are committed to  engaging directly with Inuit through the  Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee as  we apply the Inuit Nunangat Policy to  our programs  policies and services.  In addition  we will expand  opportunities for territorial and  provincial governments and Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners to  join or support Canadian delegations  at bilateral or international Arctic  meetings and treaty negotiations if  in  such meetings and negotiations  their  rights or interests could potentially   be impacted.   We will also continue to provide a  critical coordination function for  multi-stakeholder Arctic events to  support a strong Canadian presence.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy CONCLUSION  The Arctic is a region of tremendous opportunity thanks  to its plentiful resources and resilient people.   However  Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine  rapidly   advancing climate change and increasing interest in  the Arctic from non-Arctic states has led to increased  competition and geopolitical tension in the region.   To ensure that the Arctic remains stable  prosperous and  secure and to fully implement the objectives laid out  in the International chapter of the ANPF  Canada needs  a diplomatic strategy that responds to this evolving  geopolitical context.  The Arctic Foreign Policy reorients Canada’s approach  to the Arctic based on a clear-eyed assessment of the  threats Canada faces today  and those it anticipates in  the future. It aligns Canada’s foreign and defence policy  to ensure the security of Canadians and ensures that  together with its allies  Canada can guard against and  defend itself against threats from its adversaries   in the Arctic.  By reinforcing the pillars of Arctic governance and the  principles of the rules-based international order  this  policy will help to safeguard the collective interests   of the peoples of the Arctic from those who would   seek to impose their wills.   This policy will strengthen our relationships with   territorial and provincial governments  Arctic and   northern Indigenous governments and organizations   and other northerners. It will produce new and more  effective ways of working together on Arctic diplomacy  that will transform Canada’s approach   to international engagement.  Canadian diplomacy has a role to play in building  renewed relationships with First Nations  Inuit  Métis   Modern Treaty and Self-Governing Partners; relationships  that are based on the recognition of rights  respect   and partnership.  The Arctic Foreign Policy is built on a vision of shared  cooperation and prosperity for all the peoples of the  Arctic who are committed to peace and stability.   Together  we can realize this future and ensure Canada’s  place as a leader in the Arctic for generations to come.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  47  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Annex: Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   development process and Canada’s Arctic   and\\tNorthern\\tPolicy\\tFramework\\t(ANPF) \\t  published in 2019  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   development process  In the spirit of the principle of “nothing about us without  us ” the Arctic Foreign Policy was developed on the basis  of extensive and distinctions-based engagement and  on collaboration and cooperation with domestic rights  holders from Canada’s Arctic and North  including First  Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-Governing  Partners and organizations; the territorial governments  (the Northwest Territories  Nunavut and the Yukon);  and provincial governments (Manitoba  Newfoundland  and Labrador and Quebec). We engaged partners in a  variety of formats  including bilateral meetings  regional  round-table discussions and ANPF   governance mechanisms.  The Arctic Foreign Policy is guided by all relevant  treaties and self-government agreements with Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners  including obligations  Canada has to Indigenous Peoples under those treaties  and agreements  and the rights recognized and affirmed  under section 35 of the Constitution Act  1982. It is further  guided by the Yukon Northern Affairs Program   Devolution Transfer Agreement (2003)  the Northwest  Territories Devolution Agreement (2014)  the United  Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  (endorsed by Canada in 2020)  the Inuit Nunangat Policy  (2022) and the Nunavut Lands and Resources Devolution   Agreement (2024).  The policy development process was also informed by  engagement with like-minded Arctic states; specifically   the Kingdom of Denmark  Finland  Iceland  Norway   Sweden and the United States.    48  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   Canada’s ANPF  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy complements and  supports the implementation of the ANPF  which was  published in 2019. The ANPF was co-developed with  over 25 First Nations  Inuit and Métis governments and  organizations  as well as with territorial and   provincial governments.   The ANPF sets out a common vision of a future where  Arctic and northern peoples are thriving  strong and  safe. The framework includes a co-developed policy  statement and the whole-of-government International  chapter  which articulates Canada’s goals and objectives  for the circumpolar Arctic in 3 key areas that   remain in effect:  1. Strengthening the rules-based   international order in the Arctic   2. More clearly defining Canada’s    Arctic boundaries   3. Broadening Canada’s international    engagement to contribute to the priorities   of the Canadian Arctic   The implementation of the International chapter has  been supported by Global Affairs Canada’s Global   Arctic Leadership Initiative with an annual budget   of $7 million each year to strengthen Canada’s global   leadership in the Arctic.  The ANPF’s Safety  security and defence chapter also  underlines the importance of strengthening cooperation  with international partners on safety  security   and defence issues.  Canada remains committed to strengthening Arctic   and northern infrastructure and to closing infrastructure  gaps with other regions of Canada to forge opportunities   for economic development  to address reconciliation    to increase resilience and to contribute to Arctic defence  and security.

It also   complements  and benefits from  the historic investments  Canada is making in its national defence and security  through its 2024 defence policy update Our North    Strong and Free.   It will make Canada more secure  especially for Canadians  living in the North. It will support strong and resilient Arctic  and Northern communities. It will also serve to advance the  interests and priorities of Indigenous Peoples and   northerners who call the Arctic home.  Canada’s new policy is based on a shared vision of the   Arctic’s future; I am confident Canada will realize its   ambitions through this policy.  The Honourable Mélanie Joly  P.C.  M.P.  Minister of Foreign Affairs  Canada is at an inflection point in the Arctic.   For many years  Canada has aimed to manage the Arctic  and northern regions cooperatively with other states as a  zone of low tension that is free from military competition  This approach had significant benefits  uniting the Arctic  nations to advance cooperation on issues of common  interest  such as sustainable development  environmental  protection and scientific collaboration  including through   the establishment of the Arctic Council in Ottawa in 1996.  However  the guardrails that we have depended on to  prevent and resolve conflict have weakened. Russia’s illegal  war in Ukraine has made cooperation with it on Arctic issues  exceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future. Uncertainty  and unpredictability are creating economic consequences  that Canadians are facing everyday.  Threats to Canada’s security are no longer bound by  geography; climate change is accelerating rapidly; and  non-Arctic states  including China  are also seeking greater  influence in the governance of the Arctic. To respond   Canada must be strong in the North American Arctic  and  it requires deeper collaboration with its greatest ally  the  United States. Canada must also maintain strong ties with   its 5 Nordic allies  which are now also all NATO members.  The evolving security and political dynamics in the   Arctic have triggered a need for a recalibrated diplomatic  approach to advancing Canada’s national interests in the  region  based on the principles of pragmatic diplomacy.   The Arctic Foreign Policy  a diplomatic strategy  addresses  the challenges and opportunities Canada faces today  as  well as those it expects to face in the coming decades. It  gives Canada the diplomatic tools it needs to continue to  assert its sovereignty  advance its national security interests  and promote a stable  prosperous and secure Arctic.   This policy is built on  and benefits from  the knowledge  and perspectives of Indigenous Peoples who call the Arctic  home. It comes from a place of understanding that there is  a dark chapter in Government of Canada policy in the Arctic   which includes forced relocations of Inuit to the High Arctic  and other colonial policies. These have inflicted significant  intergenerational trauma on Indigenous Peoples.   2  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Foreword: Message from   the\\tMinister\\tof\\tNorthern\\tAffairs  The new Arctic Foreign Policy will expand and broaden  Canada’s international engagement  strengthen relations  with our international partners and exercise Canada’s   sovereignty in the Canadian Arctic. It will also advance  domestic priorities  including enhancing knowledge of   the North  protecting the Arctic environment  and   advancing reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples   throughout the North.   By placing the invaluable perspectives  knowledge  and  wisdom of Indigenous Peoples in the North  who have  called the Arctic home since time immemorial  at the  foreground this new policy and its implementation  we will  ensure that the Arctic remains a vibrant  prosperous  and  secure region now and for future generations.  The Honourable Dan Vandal  P.C.  M.P.  Minister of Northern Affairs  Released in 2019  the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework  (‘the Framework’) was co-developed with over 25 First  Nations  Inuit  and Métis governments  organizations   and territorial and provincial governments. It laid out a  shared vision to ensure that the needs and priorities of the  North remain paramount: “Strong  self-reliant people and  communities working together for a vibrant  prosperous and  sustainable Arctic and northern region at home and abroad   while expressing Canada’s enduring Arctic sovereignty.”   The launch of Canada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy builds on  the International Chapter of the Framework and is a pivotal  moment in the realization of our shared vision for the Arctic.  Informed by engagements with Indigenous Peoples and  Northerners and their vast knowledge in the region  as well  as with territorial and provincial governments  this Policy  reflects the federal government’s international approach to  the Arctic to ensure that Canada remains well-positioned   as an Arctic leader.   The Arctic Foreign Policy will promote a safe  strong    and thriving future for those who live in the Arctic and   the North  while protecting Canada’s enduring Arctic   sovereignty. It considers the shifting geopolitical context  and puts forward plans to ensure that the Canadian Arctic  remains strong and adaptable on the international stage   now and into the future. Just as Indigenous partners are  instrumental in the ongoing implementation of the   Framework  the success of this new foreign policy will  depend on continued learning from the immeasurable  experience  knowledge  and wisdom of First Nations  Inuit   Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-Governing partners and  communities. This shared learning is critical to a strong and  sustainable Arctic and to the full and effective implemen- tation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples Act.   Through this Policy  Canada’s approach to the Arctic will be  developed with respect for Indigenous self-determination  and the values  interests  cultures  and traditions of Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples  including weaving   traditional knowledge into Arctic decision-making   at the global level.   3  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Foreword: Message from   the Minister of National Defence  Canada remains committed to contributing to NATO   and NORAD’s awareness of the threat environment across  the Arctic region  including in the North American Arctic.   We likewise support the continued leadership of   like-minded Arctic states on matters of security   and defence.  The Arctic security and continental defence investments  made in Our North  Strong and Free and NORAD   Modernization support NATO’s deterrence and   defence agenda by protecting the Alliance’s Northern   and Western flanks. It ensures that Canada can engage   in the world and deploy from a secure base in support   of NATO allies  when needed.  As we expand and enhance our presence in the Arctic  we  recognize that this will also impact the communities who  inhabit the region. Indigenous Peoples have called the  Arctic home since time immemorial  and working with them  will enhance the prosperity and defence of the region.   Our government will continue to prioritize working with   Indigenous communities in the Arctic and deepening   our relationship with them.  As the world continues to evolve and threats intensify    the connection between foreign policy and defence policy  must remain strong for the protection of our country   and our values. This Arctic Foreign Policy complements  Canada’s ongoing work in the region to expand our   presence and safeguard our sovereignty in the Arctic.   The Honourable William Sterling Blair  P.C.  C.O.M.  M.P.  Minister of National Defence  Canada has benefited enormously from our geography.  Surrounded by 3 oceans  and our closest ally to the south   our country has enjoyed a degree of protection that has  helped keep our borders safe and secure. That reality is  changing in the Arctic. Where the polar ice caps provided  physical protection  the region is now opening to the world  as it warms at 4 times the global average.  In the coming decades  the Arctic Ocean will become a vital  shipping route between Europe and Asia  while vast stores  of natural resources become increasingly accessible.   This growing access is already enticing nations to   the region  heightening security challenges and   geopolitical competition.   Canada must urgently strengthen our presence in the Arctic  and northern regions as our adversaries aspire to a greater  role in the region’s affairs. The physical threat of climate  change is compounded by challenges from authoritarian  states to the rules-based international order that Canada  and its allies strive to uphold. Simultaneously  the character  of conflict is changing with rapid technological and   cyber advances.     Canada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy responds to these  growing challenges by focusing on 3 key areas: asserting  Canada’s sovereignty  advancing our interests in the region   and promoting a stable  prosperous  and secure North.   The policy addresses current needs and challenges while   anticipating how the region will change in the coming  decades. It also provides the diplomatic tools we need  to partner with Northern communities to assert Canada’s  sovereignty and to support Arctic and Northern people   so that they can thrive and remain secure.  The Arctic Foreign Policy complements the work and   investments outlined in our new defence policy update   Our North  Strong and Free  which was developed in part as  a response to the emerging threats in the Arctic and around  the world. Our North  Strong and Free focuses on   Canadian values and strengths while underpinning   our Arctic and Northern sovereignty  strengthening our   diplomatic influence  and leveraging our world-leading  cyber and space talent. It reinforces our capabilities and  capacity in the region  in partnership with those   who live there.  4  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Executive summary  Canada is an Arctic nation.  Canada launched the co-developed Arctic and Northern  Policy Framework (ANPF) in 2019  which sets out a   common vision of the Arctic and the North  in which   the peoples there are thriving  strong and secure.   Since then  strategic competition has intensified across the  globe as major powers that do not share Canadian interests  and values seek to shape the international environment to  their advantage. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022   for example  has shaken the foundations of international  cooperation in the Arctic.   At the same time  the Arctic is experiencing the   considerable impacts of climate change  with significant   implications for the security of the communities and people  who live in the Arctic. By 2050  the Arctic Ocean will become  an increasingly viable shipping route between Europe and  Asia during the summer.  More than ever  the Arctic is a theatre of interest for many  non-Arctic states and actors aspiring for a greater role in  Arctic affairs. Canada’s adversaries also try to achieve   influence through non-military tactics  including cyber  activities  foreign interference and economic coercion.  The North American Arctic is no longer free from tension.  Canada must work even closer with its closest ally  the   United States  to maintain a secure North American  homeland. Canada should also be closer than ever   to its Nordic allies.  To respond to these emerging geopolitical dynamics   and to align more closely with the defence policy update   Our North  Strong and Free  Canada has developed  in   partnership with northern and Indigenous Peoples  the  Arctic Foreign Policy to supplement the International   chapter of the ANPF. This policy will help ensure that the  Arctic remains a stable  prosperous and secure region   for future generations.  The Arctic Foreign Policy provides new funding over   the next 5 years to ensure that Global Affairs Canada1   is fit-for-purpose in the Arctic. The policy also benefits   Canadians who live in the Arctic and in the North    including by strengthening their ties and connections   across borders.   To achieve its objective of a stable  prosperous and secure  Arctic  Canada will continue to assert its sovereignty. Canada  will also advance its national interests through pragmatic  diplomacy; lead on Arctic governance and multilateral  challenges; and adopt a more inclusive approach   to Arctic diplomacy.  As part of this policy  Canada will:    appoint an Arctic ambassador     open a new consulate in Anchorage  Alaska    open a new consulate in Nuuk  Greenland    initiate an Arctic security dialogue with the ministers   of foreign affairs of like-minded states in the Arctic    expand information sharing with relevant territorial and  provincial governments and Indigenous leaders on  emerging and developing international Arctic security  trends  including foreign interference threats    support science and research coordination initiatives   with foreign policy considerations as related to research  security and science in the Arctic     launch boundary negotiations with the United States   regarding the Beaufort Sea and finalize the implementa- tion of the boundary agreement between Canada   and the Kingdom of Denmark regarding Tartupaluk   (Hans Island)  Canada remains deeply committed to the full implementa- tion of the ANPF  to Arctic state primacy and to upholding  the rules-based international order2 in the Arctic. The Arctic  Foreign Policy will provide new tools for Canada to deliver  on the objectives set out in the ANPF in a changing   geopolitical context.  This foreign policy will secure its national interests   and ensure stability and prosperity for the Indigenous   Peoples who live in the Arctic and the North—including   First Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-  Governing Partners—and other northerners. Canada’s  diplomacy is stronger when it is informed by Indigenous  Knowledge  culture and practices  as well as by the lived  experiences of northerners who call the Arctic home.  1\\t Hereafter \\tall\\tuses\\tof\\tthe\\tfirst-person\\tplural—we \\tus \\tour\\tand\\tours—are\\tin\\treference\\tto\\tGlobal\\tAffairs\\tCanada.  2\\tThe\\trules-based\\tinternational\\torder\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tis\\tthe\\tsum\\tof\\tinternational\\trules \\tnorms\\tand\\tinstitutions\\tthat\\tgovern\\tinternational\\taffairs\\tthere.  5  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy STRATEGIC  CHALLENGES   IN THE ARCTIC  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  6  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 1.  Russia     since 2022  Canada has been clear that there will be no business as usual with Russia  at the Arctic  Council or elsewhere  since its illegal  full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally changed the geopolitical  landscape  with spillover effects in the Arctic. It is an attack not only against Ukraine   but also on the fundamental principles of international relations  including respect   for sovereignty  territorial integrity and international law.   In addition to the existential threat Russian aggression poses to Ukraine and its people   Russian president Putin’s war on Ukraine risks setting a broader post-Cold-War   precedent that borders can be redrawn through violence.  Northerners understand how close a neighbour Russia is. Canada must be clear-eyed  about the implications of its geographic proximity to Russia. Canadian Forces Station  Alert  on Ellesmere Island  Nunavut  is closer to the Russian military’s air force base   at Nagurskoye  Russia  than Iqaluit is to Ottawa or Toronto is to Winnipeg.   For over a decade  Russia has invested in modernizing its Arctic infrastructure and its  military capabilities in the Arctic to develop resources and control access to the region   with particular emphasis on its own western region and approaches. It is looking to  profit from climate change in the region and will continue promoting the development  of the Northern Sea Route as a major international shipping route. Given the strategic  importance Russia places on its Arctic region  Canada expects these activities   will continue.  Russia has also intensified its disinformation campaigns  conducted below-threshold  military activities3  and crafted a vehement domestic narrative of a “hostile  unfriendly  West ” in part to justify its own militarization of the Arctic.   Russia’s historic posture has been to ensure sovereignty and control over its own Arctic  region and to limit the role of non-Arctic states in Arctic affairs. However  because of  sanctions and of its massive expenditures on its illegal war against Ukraine  Russia  is increasingly reliant on China to fund and support the development of its projects  in the Arctic. These include investments in Arctic research  oil and gas development   ports and other critical infrastructure. We anticipate this trend will continue and lead to  increased activity by China in the Russian Arctic.   Russia and China are aligned in their desire to undermine the liberal-rules-based  international system  but the power asymmetry between them often highlights the  divergence in their interests. Russia is increasingly dependent on China and is reversing  its historic posture by opening its Arctic to China. For instance  in July 2024  Russia and  China  building on their 2022 statement to cooperate in the Arctic  conducted joint  military exercises in the Russian High North. In addition  Russian and Chinese warships  have conducted joint patrols in international waters off the Aleutian Islands; the   2 countries’ coast guards have conducted joint patrols into the Bering Sea; and Russian  and Chinese military aircraft have been detected  tracked and intercepted by the North  American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) while flying in Alaska’s Air Defense  Identification Zone. This demonstrates the continued deepening of Chinese-Russian  military cooperation  particularly in the North Pacific approaches to the Arctic.  3\\t\\t“Below-threshold\\tconflict ”\\talso\\tknown\\tas\\t“grey\\tzone\\tconflict ”\\trefers\\tto\\tcompetitive\\tinteraction\\tbetween\\tstates\\tthat\\tfalls\\t  \\t short\\tof\\ttraditional\\tarmed\\tconflict\\tbut\\tgoes\\tbeyond\\tnormal\\tpeaceful\\trelations.\\tSuch\\tconflict\\tinvolves\\tactions\\tthat\\tare\\t  \\t coercive\\tand\\taggressive\\tbut\\tdeliberately\\tdesigned\\tto\\tremain\\tbelow\\tthe\\tthreshold\\tof\\tarmed\\tconflict.\\tThese\\tactions\\t  \\t could\\tinclude:\\tinformation\\twarfare\\tand\\tpropaganda;\\tcyber\\tattacks\\tand\\tespionage;\\teconomic\\tcoercion;\\tpolitical\\t  \\t interference\\tand\\telection\\tmeddling;\\tthe\\tuse\\tof\\tproxy\\tforces\\tor\\tparamilitary\\tgroups;\\tor\\t“lawfare”\\tand\\t  \\t exploiting\\tlegal\\tambiguities.  7  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Evolving    security    threats across    the Arctic  8  The Arctic is a strategically important region for the defence of North America and the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO’s) northern and western flanks. However    the defence architecture and threat picture differ across the circumpolar north.   The safety  security and defence of the Canadian Arctic comprise a fundamental  priority for the Government of Canada and are critical to the collective defence of North  America. The Arctic regions of North America are protected by the armed forces of  Canada and the United States  individually and bilaterally  and through NORAD    which is binational.  While the risk of military attack in the North American Arctic remains low  the region  represents a geographic vector for traditional and emerging weapons systems  that threaten broader North American and transatlantic security. Canada is seeing  a number of potential threats  including increased Russian activity in Canadian air  approaches  China’s regular deployment of dual-use—having both research and  military application—research vessels and surveillance platforms to collect data  and a  general increase in Arctic maritime activity. Adversaries and competitors also employ  disinformation and influence campaigns  malicious cyber operations and espionage  and foreign interference activities to target Canadians  including northerners.  Close partnership with the United States is essential to the maintenance of a secure   strong and well-defended North American homeland  on which the 2 countries’ mutual  prosperity depends. It is critical in deterring and defending against increasingly sophis- ticated threats to North America  including in the Arctic and its approaches in the North  Atlantic and North Pacific. We expect Canada–United States defence cooperation in  the Arctic to continue to grow  as it is fundamental to both countries’ national   security interests.  Strong and resilient Arctic and northern communities increase Canada’s defence  against threats. With increased tension and with competitors looking to exploit  vulnerabilities in the Canadian North  Canada must take action to build trust in public  institutions and deepen ties with like-minded states. Canada’s diplomacy and defence  and security policies must work hand in hand to keep these emerging threats in check.  The security of the European High North is also of critical importance to Canada’s  security and economic well-being.  The European High North is a contested region militarily  including threats to critical  infrastructure  maritime security  and safety  as well as access concerns. Russia has  established a strong military presence in the Arctic  including with air and naval   platforms equipped with missile systems capable of striking Europe and North   America and of disrupting Canada’s ability to project forces in support of allies and  partners. Russia’s below-threshold actions  military activities and continued weapons  testing in the European High North and the Arctic are deeply troubling.  NATO has strengthened its deterrence and defence posture  including in the European  High North  in response to the increased threat posed by Russia. The accessions of  Finland and Sweden to NATO  in 2023 and 2024 respectively  reinforced the Alliance by  bringing  among other things  their significant cold-weather experience and capabilities  to NATO  thereby bolstering its strategic posture in the European High North. Canada  was the first country to ratify each of their accessions. Canada will continue to share  information on threats in the Arctic with allies and to support NATO operations and  presence in the European High North.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Despite the changing threat picture  it is not in Canada’s strategic interest that the Arctic  becomes a theatre of military conflict. Canada will continue working with territorial   and provincial governments  Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples and allies and   partners throughout the Arctic region to enhance domain awareness  improve   information sharing and strengthen interoperability and research security.  Canada must also take action to mitigate the impact that current and emerging  defence and security threats to the Arctic have on the people who live in the region  and who now find themselves at the frontlines of geopolitical competition.

Adapting    to new    dynamics    for Arctic   governance  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has had cascading impacts on the governance of the  Arctic. While Arctic states continue to fulfill the important responsibility of governing  the Arctic region at a time of unprecedented change  like-minded countries are taking  coordinated action to ensure it is not business as usual with Russia.  The Arctic Council is the pre-eminent forum for international Arctic cooperation   and governance. It brings together the 8 Arctic states  the 6 Permanent Participant   organizations representing Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic  and observers to address   sustainable development and the environmental protection of the Arctic. The role  of Arctic Indigenous Peoples  from the foundation of the Arctic Council in 1996 to  the present  is one of the council’s greatest strengths and is unique in multilateral  governance. The council sets the bar for meaningful Indigenous engagement  which  continues to grow to this day. Arctic governance must be done with those who have  lived in the Arctic for thousands of years  recognizing the strength of shared knowledge  and decision making.   Meetings with all members of the council at the ministerial and Senior Arctic Official   levels remain on hold. Arctic states and Permanent Participants are working at the  expert and scientific level to advance important projects on climate change and  biodiversity  emergency prevention and preparedness and sustainable development.  These projects  along with the other work of the Arctic Council  are helping to drive  meaningful change for people who live across the Arctic. This unique work  done in  collaboration between the Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic and the Arctic states    is what makes the Arctic Council so valuable.  To ensure the maintenance of robust governance in the Arctic—governance that is  capable of tackling the increasing challenges and opportunities the region is facing— cooperation must continue at the Arctic Council. Canada must also identify new forums  and leverage existing ones in new ways to advance discussions on Arctic issues. Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples must be active partners in the conduct of   international relations in the Arctic.   Arctic states also meet in other regional and international forums that contribute to  upholding the rules-based international order  including the Arctic Coast Guard Forum  and the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement. The latter came into force in 2021   establishing a precautionary 16-year ban on commercial fishing on the high seas of   the Arctic Ocean.  Arctic states also play a leading role in advancing Arctic interests in broader global  efforts through the UN system  such as the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s)  ban on heavy fuel oil in the Arctic.  An extensive international legal framework applies to the Arctic Ocean. The law of  the sea  including as set out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)   determines states’ jurisdictions and their rights and obligations in various maritime  zones. These rules apply to the delineation of the outer limits of continental shelves   navigation  the management of natural resources  the protection of the marine environ- ment and other uses of the sea. Consistent with the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration4  Canada  remains committed to the orderly settlement of Arctic disputes in accordance with  international law and expects the same of other signatories  including Russia.  4\\t\\tThe\\tIlulissat\\tDeclaration\\twas\\tsigned\\tby\\tthe\\t5\\tArctic\\tOcean\\tcoastal\\tstates\\t(Canada \\tthe\\tUnited\\tStates \\tthe\\tKingdom\\tof\\t  \\t Denmark \\tNorway\\tand\\tRussia)\\tat\\tIlulissat \\tGreenland \\tin\\tMay\\t2008.\\tIn\\tthe\\tdeclaration \\tthe\\t5\\tstates\\tpledged\\tto\\tenhance\\t  \\t their\\tscientific\\tand\\tenvironmental\\tcooperation\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tOcean.\\tThey\\talso\\tcommitted\\tto\\tthe\\torderly\\tsettlement\\tof\\t  \\t overlaps\\tin\\ttheir\\trespective\\textended\\tcontinental\\tshelves \\tin\\taccordance\\twith\\tinternational\\tlaw.  11  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Canada has a clear interest in maintaining the structures of governance in   the Arctic that ensure Canada’s central role in guiding the region’s future.   Canada especially values the Arctic Council because it provides a platform   for Indigenous Peoples to help shape circumpolar affairs. Canada will not   allow Russia to undermine  through its actions  the pillars of international   cooperation in the Arctic.

Climate     change: the    overarching    threat  Climate change is both the most pressing and the most proximate threat to Canada’s  security in the Arctic and the people who live there. Its causes and effects are not  bound by countries’ official borders.  Climate change is progressing at an alarming pace  with the Arctic warming 4 times  faster than the global average  causing significant impacts on natural and human   environments. These impacts serve as threat multipliers because changing environ- mental conditions create additional opportunities for foreign adversaries and   competitors to covertly or overtly operate in the Canadian Arctic.  The total surface area of Arctic Ocean ice is shrinking  with varied implications for  maritime shipping  trade and resource extraction across the Arctic. Maritime traffic in  the Arctic will continue to increase  which will drive further foreign interest in the region.  This includes maritime traffic in Canada’s Arctic Archipelago  despite the risks and  hazards associated with the unpredictable ice conditions.  With retreating sea ice and new technologies improving navigation and accessibility   foreign activity in the Arctic will continue to increase  bringing with it related safety   security and environmental challenges. With other Arctic states  Canada must be  prepared to respond.  Climate change is also driving an increase in climate-related emergencies and   disrupting ecosystems that Arctic communities rely on for their livelihoods  with   significant implications for the security of northerners  including Indigenous Peoples   who are disproportionately affected by these changes.  Northerners  including Indigenous Peoples  have shared concerns about climate  change and their ongoing efforts to improve their resiliency in the face of increased  pressures on communities and livelihoods  food security and the destabilization of  critical and civilian infrastructure. The disappearance of year-round ice cover and  changes in the timing and durability of the floe edge; increasing subsidence due to  permafrost thaw; and a greater frequency and severity of wildfires are examples of the  impacts of climate change on Arctic communities  all of which have both material and  psychological impacts.  For instance  communities in the North are often impacted by major wildfires. In 2023   more than half of the population of the Northwest Territories had to be evacuated.   There is an ongoing need to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change in the  Arctic to reduce vulnerabilities. Canada must support Arctic and northern Indigenous  Peoples and other northerners in adapting to the environment as it is and will be—not  as one wishes it would be.   In parallel  climate change is driving interest in the Arctic as a sustainable and reliable  source of critical minerals  such as lithium  graphite  nickel  cobalt  copper and rare  earth elements integral to the transition to a low-carbon economy. For Canada and  its allies  the Arctic’s resource potential provides an opportunity to diversify critical  mineral production in partnership with territorial and provincial governments  Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples and local communities. This must be done carefully   respecting the livelihoods of local communities.   Climate change is a global problem; it requires global solutions and multilateral collaboration.  13  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 5.  Increasing     challenges to    Arctic states’    primacy  Canada’s approach to the Arctic is guided by the fundamental principle that the Arctic  should be governed by the Arctic states in collaboration with Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples. As in other regions  strategic competition in the Arctic is growing   with non-Arctic states and actors increasingly expressing foreign policy or security  aspirations  thereby pushing for greater roles in Arctic affairs.  Since 2019  there has been a growing narrative among some non-Arctic states that  they should have a greater say in Arctic governance. China  in particular  has expressed  an ambition to become a “polar great power ” by 2030.  Among China’s priorities in the Arctic are developing commercial shipping opportuni- ties  including a “Polar Silk Road ” as well as natural resource exploitation  including of  critical minerals  oil and gas and fish. China is also active in Arctic research  much   of which can be considered dual use.  China seeks to shape the international order into a more permissive environment for  interests and values that increasingly deviate from Canada’s commitment to a rules- based international system. China can be expected to use all the tools at its disposal   to advance its geopolitical interests  including in the Arctic. Canada will challenge China  when it ought to and cooperate when its interests align with China’s.  China  like all states  has rights and responsibilities related to its use of the world’s  oceans that apply equally in the Arctic. For example  in accordance with UNCLOS   China can only conduct marine scientific research in the exclusive economic zone  of another state with the consent of that state. Canada will carefully review any such  requests related to its own exclusive economic zone and provide or withhold consent  consistent with the provisions of the convention.  14  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   Photo Credit: © Global Affairs  Canada  Consistent with its Indo-Pacific Strategy and in collaboration with partners  Canada will  always act on matters of Arctic governance to protect national and northern interests   including when dealing with China. Canada will cooperate with China to address   pressing global issues—such as climate change—that have impacts on the Arctic.  In the Canadian Arctic  Canada will always work to protect Canada’s economic security   safeguard Canadian values and protect Canadians from malign influence.  Canada will continue to work closely with the United States to counter all forms   of malign influence and activity in the North American Arctic.   In the wider region  Canada will always uphold the founding principles that under- pinned the Ottawa Declaration in 1996 on the establishment of the Arctic Council.  These include Canada’s commitment to the well-being of the inhabitants of the Arctic;  its commitment to sustainable development in the Arctic region  including economic  and social development  improved health conditions and cultural well-being; its   commitment to the protection of the Arctic environment; and its commitment to  ensure full consultation with  and the involvement of  Indigenous Peoples and their   communities and other inhabitants of the Arctic on Arctic Council activities.  At all times  Canada’s engagement in the Arctic will be focused first and foremost on  promoting and defending Canadian national interests. Canada will adopt a pragmatic  approach when circumstances require it.  15  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ARCTIC FOREIGN  POLICY PILLARS  The Arctic Foreign Policy provides Global Affairs Canada  with additional diplomatic tools to support a stable   prosperous and secure Arctic and to fully implement   the objectives laid out in the International chapter of   the ANPF given the changing geopolitical context.  We will do this by continuing to assert Canada’s   sovereignty; advancing Canada’s national interests  through pragmatic diplomacy; leading on Arctic   governance and multilateral challenges; and adopting   a more inclusive approach to Arctic diplomacy.

Leveraging diplomacy to support national defence and security  The Government of Canada will continue to take a   comprehensive approach to Arctic security by prioritizing  the security  interests and priorities of the Arctic region  and northerners  as well as Canadians more broadly.  Canada’s foreign and defence policies are closely  intertwined and complementary. Effective diplomacy  is critical for shaping the international environment to  defend and advance Canadian national interests; it is   a first line of defence for Canada’s national security.   Canada’s fundamental defence and security goal is   to prevent and defuse potential crises before they can  develop into conflict.  Canada’s national security is also supported by human  security. Strong and resilient local communities are vital  to national defence.  Canada engages in the Arctic from a position of strength  thanks to the Canadian Armed Forces’ (CAF’s) presence  and capabilities  exercises and operations  including  those of the Canadian Rangers. Canadian Rangers are  active  well-respected members of their communities   and they play a critical role in demonstrating Canadian  sovereignty over the lands  waters and ice of Canada’s  North and Arctic.  Building on the NORAD modernization investments  announced in 2022  Canada’s defence policy update  Our North  Strong and Free identified the Government of  Canada’s most pressing priority as the continued asser- tion of Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and northern  regions. Canada is making investments to ensure that  the CAF has the capabilities required to operate in an  evolving geopolitical context. By 2030  Canada will have  almost tripled its defence spending from 2015.  Strengthened military capabilities will bolster the CAF’s  ability to conduct and sustain operations in the Arctic  and create opportunities for strengthened collaboration  with allies and partners. Canada regularly invites select  allies and partners to take part in Operation NANOOK   the CAF’s signature northern operation series. Canada  also works with allies and partners on multinational  research and development activities relevant to the  conduct of defence and security operations in   the polar regions.   In addition to NORAD modernization and the defence  policy update  Canada is pursuing historic investments  to increase its military capability in the maritime domain  in the Arctic. Ensuring that Canada’s internal waters in  the Arctic are well defended is a critical component of  maintaining a secure North American homeland. Canada  will maintain strong defence capabilities in its internal  Arctic waters  including in the Northwest Passage.   17  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Here is a summary of key defence   and security investments:    Several military capabilities will play a key role in   exercising Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and  northern waters  including Canada’s 6 new Arctic  Offshore Patrol Ships; up to 15 new River Class  Destroyers; 11 new MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones;   up to 16 new P-8A Poseidon multi-mission aircraft  specialized in anti-submarine and anti-surface  warfare; and 88 new F-35A fighter aircraft.     Canada’s $38.6 billion plan to modernize NORAD will  significantly enhance domain awareness in the Arctic  and the North through the establishment of a   new northern approaches surveillance system to   complement the North Warning System and further   investment in space-based surveillance. It also  includes further investment in space-based polar  communications; additional air-to-air refuelling aircraft  to support and extend the reach of CAF operations— and NORAD operations—in Canada; additional and  longer-range air-to-air missiles for Canada’s fighter  fleet; significant infrastructure upgrades at airfields  used to support NORAD forward operations; and   more than $4 billion in new funding for science   and technology.    The defence policy update announced an additional  $8.1 billion in spending over the next 5 years and   $73 billion over the next 20 years to support   Canada’s national defence and security in the Arctic.  This includes a new fleet of airborne early warning  and control aircraft; specialized maritime sensors   including some that can be deployed by Harry  DeWolf-class Arctic Offshore Patrol vessels; a new  fleet of tactical helicopters; and a new satellite  ground station in the Arctic to enhance the use of  Canadian  U.S. and other Allied space capabilities.     The defence policy update will also establish a new  network of Northern Operational Support Hubs to  further enhance the CAF’s presence  responsiveness  and partnerships across the Arctic and the North  and invest in multi-use infrastructure that also meets  the needs of the territories  Indigenous Peoples and  northern communities.    In July 2024  Canada announced it would initiate new  spending programs to put the country on track to  reach NATO’s target of 2% of GDP spending by 2032.  This will include the purchase of up to 12 convention- ally powered  under-ice-capable submarines by the  Royal Canadian Navy.    In 2024  the Government of Canada initiated the   procurement of 8 new icebreakers made in Canada  to support Canadian Coast Guard operations in the  Arctic  including 2 polar icebreakers that will enable  year-round icebreaker presence in the Arctic. The  icebreakers will contribute to the protection of the  marine environment  the resupplying of communities  and the collection of data that enhances Canada’s  maritime domain awareness in support of maritime  safety and security  climate resilience and   scientific research.    In July 2024  Canada  the United States and Finland   announced an enhanced trilateral partnership called  the ICE Pact. It is a collaborative effort to build best- in-class Arctic and polar icebreakers and other Arctic  and polar capabilities in each of the countries by  sharing expertise  information and capabilities. This  partnership also bolsters the ability of like-minded  nations to uphold international rules  norms and  standards to ensure safety and to sustain peace and  stability in the Arctic.  The diplomatic initiatives in the Arctic Foreign Policy will  complement all of these investments by better aligning  Canada’s strategic approaches and by strengthening  its relationships with its Arctic allies  with territorial and  provincial governments and with Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners.  18  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy i.  Bridging the intelligence gap  To address the complex range of threats faced in the  Arctic  Canada must conceptualize security not only in  military terms. Security in the Arctic includes community  security  research security  economic security  security  against disinformation and any other form of interference  and physical and digital infrastructure security.  We will work with Public Safety Canada to support efforts  to strengthen Canadian national resilience to counter  malign influence and activities of foreign powers. Canada  will strengthen the defence of its critical infrastructure  across the country  including in the Arctic  to protect  northern communities against foreign interference. This  can be achieved through the Investment Canada Act;  by strengthening Canadian cyber security systems; and  through new legislation to address foreign interference.  We will provide relevant territorial   provincial and Indigenous  governments with regular briefings  and information on emerging and  developing international security  trends  including threats affecting the  Arctic  to ensure that they are equipped  to support communities in Canada’s  Arctic and North and to make informed  decisions about the security of their  communities.  This will be achieved in collaboration  with the Canadian Security Intelligence  Service  the Communications Security  Establishment  the Department of  National Defence and Public   Safety Canada.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  19  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Canada will support territorial  provincial  and Indigenous authorities in taking into  account a national security lens to foreign  research in Canada’s Arctic.   Global Affairs Canada will support the  work of Innovation  Science and Economic  Development Canada  Crown-Indigenous  Relations and Northern Affairs and its  portfolio agencies  the Department of  National Defence  Natural Resources  Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada   among others  to support the scientific  research permitting process in the Arctic   particularly for international applicants  undertaking research that can be  considered dual use.  To help ensure emerging challenges  concerning research security and science  collaboration in the North are addressed    we will help by increasing our capacity  to learn about concerns from those on  the ground  holding annual round-table  meetings on science and research relating  to Canada’s Arctic foreign policy priorities.  We will work closely with other federal  government departments and agencies   to organize the round-table meetings.  The Arctic ambassador (see Pillar 4 -  Adopting a more inclusive approach to  Arctic diplomacy) will work with Indigenous  Peoples and partners from territorial and  provincial governments  as well as across  the Government of Canada  to contribute  to the efforts to address climate change   biodiversity and other areas where  Indigenous Knowledge  science and  technologies could contribute solutions   to the challenges in the Arctic.  The Arctic ambassador will also work with  Canada’s Chief Science Advisor on issues  related to science and research.  20  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  ii.  Strengthening research security  International scientific collaboration plays an important  role in addressing gaps in knowledge of the Arctic  region  including in relation to climate change. The last  20 years have seen a marked increase in international  research activity across the Canadian and   circumpolar Arctic.   While Canada continues to welcome scientific   collaboration in the Arctic  Canada’s oversight  regu- latory  safety and security bodies must be equipped  to address potential threats and harms at all levels. In  particular  Canada must guard against foreign research  in the Canadian Arctic and North that is dual use—having  both research and military application.   This requires balancing between the important priority  of advancing recognized areas of needed international  scientific collaboration  such as climate change research   with necessary due diligence to protect Canada’s most  sensitive research.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy iii. Partnering with the Canadian Coast Guard      to support defence and security  The Canadian Coast Guard  alongside other partner  departments and agencies  is responsible for maritime  domain awareness and plays a critical role in supporting  the defence and security of the North.  Building on the Canadian Coast Guard Arctic Strategy   released in 2024  the Canadian Coast Guard will continue  to contribute to Canada’s national security  including  through its assistance to Arctic scientific   research expeditions.  The Canadian Coast Guard currently operates up to   6 icebreakers in the Arctic from June to November each  year  which helps advance maritime safety and security.  In the coming years  the Canadian Coast Guard will  acquire 8 new icebreakers  including 2 polar icebreakers  that will provide capacity for year-round presence   in the Arctic.  The Canadian Coast Guard also helps to deepen  Canadian defence cooperation with Arctic allies through  Operation Pacer Goose. The annual operation resupplies  the United States’ Pituffik Space Base (formerly known  as Thule Air Base) in Greenland  ensuring that essential  supplies are safely delivered in challenging   Arctic conditions.  To strengthen the interconnections  between the Arctic Foreign Policy  and the Canadian Coast Guard Arctic  Strategy  we will collaborate more  closely with the Canadian Coast  Guard to leverage its maritime  domain expertise and support its  work with international partners.  Through its operations and activities   the Canadian Coast Guard helps  contribute to stronger relationships with  Canada’s Arctic allies. Through deeper  collaboration  the Canadian Coast  Guard will also be able to expand its  partnerships with regional coast guards  from like-minded states.   21  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy iv. Strengthening regional defence      and security architectures  To respond to the evolving threat landscape in the Arctic   Canada will strengthen coordination and dialogue with  Arctic allies on security issues.  Alongside the Department of National Defence  we  will increase our information sharing with NATO on  circumpolar threats. We will improve interoperability and  increase the collective understanding of the evolving  security situation in the Arctic and enhance the Alliance’s  cold-weather capabilities. Canada will continue to be  an active participant in NATO exercises and operations   including in the European High North.  To ensure seamless situational awareness and informa- tion sharing on northern threats that do not recognize  borders or military command areas of responsibility   Canada supports greater coordination and collaboration  between the military forces of like-minded Arctic states   including in the context of NATO and NORAD activities.  Canada will explore and foster new partnerships to  strengthen the strategic resilience of the North American  Arctic  particularly with Alaska  the Yukon  the Northwest  Territories  Nunavut and Greenland.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  To complement existing defence forums  Canada is exploring opportunities to deepen  security dialogue among all like-minded states in the Arctic  including through regular  security discussions.    Canada will initiate an Arctic security dialogue with the ministers of foreign affairs of  like-minded states in the Arctic. Discussions will focus on sharing information on  and  on analyses of  issues relating to international Arctic relations and security; as well  as discussing national approaches to cross-cutting security challenges; advancing  opportunities for collaboration; and increasing collective resilience.  22  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Upholding the rules-based international order  The waters of Canada’s Arctic Archipelago  including   the various channels comprising the Northwest Passage   are internal waters of Canada by virtue of historic title  and in accordance with international law. Canada’s Arctic  sovereignty encompasses land  sea and ice. It extends  without interruption to the seaward-facing coasts of the  Arctic islands and beyond. These islands are joined  not  divided  by the waters between them and are bridged for  a large part of the year by ice.  Indigenous Peoples in Canada have used and occupied  the ice and waters as they have used and occupied  the lands for thousands of years. Every day  through a  wide range of activities  Arctic and northern Indigenous  Peoples and governments  as well as territorial and  provincial governments and other northerners  share  stewardship over the Arctic lands and waters of Canada.  It is through the reciprocal recognition of each other’s  mutual interests in these lands and waters that Canada  and Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples share in the  stewardship of them—further codified in modern treaties  and self-government agreements. Sovereignty and   sovereign rights in the Arctic are inextricably linked   to issues of Indigenous self-government. Canada   possesses environmental  economic  cultural and   historical interests unique to the region  the reality  and importance of which are clearly evidenced by  long-standing usage.  Canada will work with Arctic and  northern Indigenous partners to assert  shared interests and priorities in the  region  such as through partnerships  with the Inuit Marine Monitoring  Program and the Indigenous  Guardians program.5 These initiatives  provide Indigenous Peoples with  greater opportunities to exercise  responsibility for the stewardship of  their traditional lands  waters and ice.  Canada intends to continue to act as a responsible  sovereign of its Arctic territories and waters  relying on  the rules-based international order and supported by  historical and scientific evidence. Canada’s commitment  to ensuring that maritime claims are addressed in a  manner that is consistent with international law is one   of its key enduring priorities in the Arctic.

Managing Arctic boundaries through    a rules-based approach  At a time when the rules-based international order   is under unprecedented threat  it is critical that states  resolve their disputes responsibly  through dialogue  and negotiation. Canada has made resolving boundary  disputes in accordance with international law one of the  foundational principles of its foreign policy in the Arctic.  Enhanced international cooperation on maritime  boundaries also helps secure states’ respective national  interests over their resources  including energy  minerals   fish and wildlife.  Canada will advance efforts to resolve  Arctic boundary disputes peacefully  and in accordance with international  law  including UNCLOS  and in  consultation with Indigenous partners   particularly where these international  boundaries may affect treaty rights.  Canada–Kingdom of Denmark  boundary agreement  Canada  the Kingdom of Denmark  and  Greenland have resolved the maritime  boundary and long-time dispute over  Tartupaluk. In June 2022  following  5 years of intensive negotiations   the Canadian  Nunavut  Danish and  Greenlandic governments agreed  on a modernized single maritime  boundary  from the Lincoln Sea in  the north to the Labrador Sea in  the south—a distance of over 3 000  kilometres—which established the  longest bilateral maritime boundary  in the world. The agreement also  resolved the overlap in our respective  continental shelves in the Labrador Sea.  With the Kingdom of Denmark   Canada agreed to divide the island  of Tartupaluk roughly in half; Canada  is now advancing discussions on an  agreed border regime for Tartupaluk   which requires engagement with the  Government of Nunavut and local  Inuit communities. This is the last step  before the agreement can come into  force  which Canada is committed to  completing in the near future.  24  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Extended continental shelf  Canada–United States   Beaufort Sea boundary  In September 2024  Canada launched  negotiations with the United States to  resolve the 2 countries’ long-standing  maritime boundary dispute in the  Beaufort Sea. The area in question  is north of the Yukon and Alaska and  measures approximately 270 000  square kilometres. Both countries claim  jurisdiction over the disputed region  by way of differing legal interpretations  of the 1825 treaty between Russia and  Great Britain.  Reflecting the Government of Canada’s  commitment to partnership and  reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples   the boundary negotiations will involve  impacted Inuit Treaty Organizations and  close consultations with territorial and  Indigenous governments.   In December 2022  Canada filed  an addendum to its Arctic Ocean  extended continental shelf  submission with the Commission on  the Limits of the Continental Shelf  in response to Russia’s addendum   which was filed in March 2021. Russia’s  addendum greatly expanded the size  of the continental shelf included in its  submission and tripled the area that  overlaps with Canada’s own continental  shelf. Canada’s 2022 addendum  rebalanced the overlap area.  In December 2023  the United  States published the outer limits  of its extended continental shelf  in the western Arctic Ocean. This  announcement offers an opportunity  for Canada to renew negotiations  with the United States regarding the  overlap of the countries’ respective  continental shelves. These discussions  are expected to begin in late 2024.  Canada  like all Arctic Ocean coastal  states  remains committed to settling  continental shelf overlap areas  peacefully and in accordance   with international law.  25  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Advancing Canada’s interests   through pragmatic diplomacy  A fundamental principle of Canadian foreign policy is that the Arctic   should be governed by the Arctic states. This has long been a shared   principle of the Arctic states and has produced a long period    of peaceful cooperation and development in the region.   1. Strengthening Canada’s partnerships with Arctic allies  i.  The United States   The United States is Canada’s closest partner and ally   in the Arctic  and this collaboration extends across many  shared interests. Collaboration is advanced by Canada’s  extensive diplomatic network of 13 missions across the  United States and through various bilateral mechanisms.  With the United States  Canada shares a unique   relationship shaped by geography  history  shared values   common interests and strong people-to-people connec- tions. This is especially the case in the Arctic  particularly  among Indigenous Peoples  whose history  culture and  connections transcend national borders.   The Canada–United States defence partnership is  essential to maintaining a secure North American   homeland. Canada welcomes the continued partici- pation of the United States’ military and coast guard in  Canada-led exercises and operations in Canada’s   Arctic and North.  Going forward  Canada will continue to advance bilateral cooperation with the United  States in the North at all levels of government in existing areas of importance and explore  new avenues of cooperation in critical areas of national interest  including: security and  safety; the defence of North America; science and research technology; energy security;  supply chains; climate change; critical minerals; sustainable development; Indigenous  cross-border mobility; economic development; marine and terrestrial conservation; and the  protection of transboundary species  including salmon and the Porcupine caribou herd.  26  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii.   The Nordic states  Canada maintains close relations with its Nordic Arctic  neighbours; specifically  the Kingdom of Denmark  (consisting of Denmark  Greenland and the Faroe  Islands)  Finland  Iceland  Norway and Sweden. These  close relationships are underpinned by shared values   a common outlook on the world and a shared commit- ment to ensuring a peaceful and stable Arctic through  the enduring success of NATO. They continue to grow  stronger  with a particularly marked increase in dialogue  and cooperation since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now  more than ever  it is critical for Canada to have strong  partnerships with the Nordic states  as Canada and they  are all now members of NATO and Russia’s actions have  complicated cooperation in multilateral spaces of Arctic  governance. Examples of Canada’s close relationships  with its Nordic Arctic neighbours include the following:    In 2022  Canada was the first country to ratify    the accessions of Finland and Sweden to NATO.    In June 2023  Canada’s prime minister was the  invited guest at the Nordic prime ministers’   annual meeting  in Iceland.    In June 2024  the Government of Canada committed  up to $20 million in funding for an international  research initiative on the sustainable development  of the Arctic in collaboration with NordForsk  an   organization under the Nordic Council of Ministers.  It will support collaborative and multi-disciplinary  scientific efforts and contributions from across the  Arctic region and include Indigenous perspectives.    In September 2024  Canada’s minister of foreign affairs  and the premier of Nunavut co-hosted representa- tives from the Kingdom of Denmark  Finland  Iceland   Norway and Sweden for the first Canada-Nordic  Strategic Dialogue  in Iqaluit  Nunavut.    Canada is committed to deepening its partnership  with the Nordic countries as friends and allies with  common values and shared stewardship over the Arctic.  Strengthening Canada’s cooperation will also help it  respond to new threats and below-threshold activities by  its adversaries in both the North American Arctic and the  European High North.   Working in collaboration with other  federal departments  we will increase  our support for bilateral and regional  cooperation with the Kingdom of  Denmark  Finland  Iceland  Norway  and Sweden in Arctic science and  technology  climate change  culture   Indigenous-to-Indigenous ties  natural  resources  sustainable development  through trade and infrastructure and  defence and security.  We will also create a new position  in one of Canada’s Nordic missions  with responsibility for increasing  coordination and information sharing   including on security issues    with Nordic partners.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  27  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy To do this  we will open new consulates in Anchorage   Alaska  and Nuuk  Greenland.  Alaska is a key partner on a range of issues  including  border security and crossings  security and defence in  the Arctic  climate resilience and conservation  energy  security  critical minerals and Indigenous affairs.   Members of the CAF are stationed in Alaska to support  the NORAD mission and work alongside their U.S. military  counterparts in the defence of North America.  In addition  the Yukon also has mature and close-knit  bilateral relations with Alaska from both a political and  trade perspective.   iii. The North American Arctic: Alaska and Greenland  The North American Arctic encompasses the vast   northern territories of 3 countries: Alaska (the United  States) in the west; northern Canada in the centre;   and Greenland (the Kingdom of Denmark) in the east.   The relationships in this region are unique due to   geographical proximity and the ancestral relations   that exist between Indigenous Peoples  which give rise   to a number of shared interests  including on security   defence  climate change  sustainable development   critical minerals  trade  culture and Indigenous mobility.  The ANPF emphasizes increasing cooperation among  federal  territorial  provincial and Indigenous govern- ments and other organizations in and across the   Canadian Arctic and with Canada’s North American   Arctic partners.  The Arctic Foreign Policy complements this by  re-emphasizing the importance of deepening Canada’s  diplomatic engagement with its neighbours  the United  States  including Alaska  and the Kingdom of Denmark   including Greenland. This will make the Canadian and  North American Arctic more secure and create new  opportunities for economic cooperation  scientific   collaboration and cultural exchange.   The consulate in Anchorage will help promote trade and  economic ties between Canada’s territories and provinces and  Alaska; improve security and defence partnerships; strengthen  collaboration on environmental and wildlife issues; engage with  Alaskan communities  including Indigenous communities; and  support cross-border people-to-people ties.   28  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Many ties  both formal and informal  have been forged  over the years at all levels of government and between  Inuit organizations in Canada and Greenland. Several  bilateral initiatives have been advanced in recent years   including the Letter of Intent for Cooperation on the  Pikialasorsuaq (2023) and the Memorandum of Under- standing between the Government of Greenland and the  Government of Nunavut (2022). However  cooperation to  date has largely occurred organically  without an   overarching foreign policy framework.  In recognition of the growing importance of Greenland   as a key Arctic partner  a more coordinated approach  with Greenland  including with the government of   Nunavut  is a priority in ensuring that Canadian   interests are being advanced effectively.  The consulate in Nuuk will be a  valuable resource for coordinating  and advancing Canadian interests in  Greenland  enhancing bilateral and  commercial relations  facilitating  research collaboration and supporting  increased engagement and  collaboration across many   policy spaces.  We welcome Greenland’s  commitment to open a  representational office in Canada.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  29  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Holding    Russia    accountable  Russia represents a generational geopolitical challenge.  Although Russia accounts for 50% of the Arctic   geographically  bilateral cooperation between Canada  and Russia  including in the Arctic  will remain   exceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future.  Canada will continue to hold Russia accountable in regional  and multilateral forums for its actions and counter disinformation  promoted by the Russian regime  including through Canada’s  leadership of the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism. This includes  countering disinformation targeting communities   in the Canadian Arctic.   Alongside allies and partners  Canada will continue confronting  Russian aggression  including through Canada’s enduring   support for Ukraine  and by continuing to meet NATO   defence commitments.  Together with the United States  Canada will defend NATO’s  western flank  and with Arctic allies  Canada will defend NATO’s  northern regions and approaches.  Canada acknowledges that the actions of the Putin  regime do not always reflect the values of the Russian  people. This policy clearly differentiates between   government actions and those of the broader Russian  population  including its Indigenous Peoples  who them- selves have been marginalized by the Russian regime.  Across all multilateral bodies  Canada will maintain its  policy of limited engagement with Russian officials.  It is for Russia to create the conditions that will enable  a return to political engagement and cooperation by  ending its war in Ukraine and acting in accordance   with international law.  30  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   3.  Pragmatic    diplomacy    with non-    Arctic states    and actors  While Canada will continue to prioritize cooperation   with Arctic states  especially when it comes to setting  the rules that govern the region  cooperation with a  wider set of actors is beneficial and necessary to address  challenges to the Arctic emanating from global issues   such as climate change.  Given the prospect of growing competition in the Arctic   Canada will be strategic in prioritizing pragmatic   cooperation with non-Arctic states and actors that   align with Canadian values  interests and objectives.  Canada will be guided by the following principles:   › Respect for Arctic states’ sovereignty  sovereign rights and    jurisdiction in the Arctic.   › Support for the rules-based international order in the Arctic    and a demonstrated commitment to regional peace and stability.   › Respect for Indigenous self-determination  Indigenous rights and the values    interests  cultures and traditions of Arctic Indigenous Peoples  including the   participation of Indigenous Peoples in Arctic decision making  and other   Arctic inhabitants.   › Respect for the extensive legal framework that applies to the Arctic Ocean     including UNCLOS.   › Recognition of interests and expertise that are relevant to  and aligned with     Canada’s Arctic and northern priorities  as well as its national defence   and security interests.   › Maintaining a commitment to uphold and advance democratic values    human rights and gender equality according to international standards    regulations and principles.   › Openness with regard to scientific data sharing and collaboration   with Canadian researchers and local communities  including their   representative governments.   › Commitment to sustainable development  conservation  environmental    protection and fighting climate change.   Engagement with non-Arctic states and actors will be  channeled through a variety of multilateral forums  such  as the Arctic Council  appropriate UN bodies  NATO and  the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable  as well as treaties  that apply to the Arctic  such as the Central Arctic Ocean  Fisheries Agreement  and bilateral and multilateral   platforms and projects that we will drive with other  federal departments and agencies.  Going forward  based on the above principles  Canada  will place particular emphasis on cooperation with  non-Arctic states and actors in 2 regions: the North  Atlantic and the North Pacific.  31  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy The North Atlantic  Canada will strengthen engagement  on Arctic matters with the European  Union  the United Kingdom and other  key North Atlantic states through  established mechanisms  such as the  Canada–European Union Strategic  Partnership Agreement. Science   technology and innovation will remain  the focus of Canada’s cooperation with  the European Union and key European  states through Canada’s engagement  on the European Union–United  States–Canada Arctic Working Group  of the All-Atlantic Ocean Research  and Innovation Alliance; the Canada- European Union Ocean Partnership  Forum; and the Horizon   Europe program.  Other priorities for Arctic cooperation include facilitating  the mobility of Inuit between Canada and Greenland;  facilitating the trade of  and access to  the seal products  of Inuit and other Indigenous Peoples  in the E.U. market;  the conservation of fish stocks through the Canada– European Union High-Level Dialogue on Fisheries;   environmental protection; climate mitigation and   adaptation; trade and sustainable economic   development; security cooperation through   high-level dialogues; and the Canada–European   Union Green Alliance.  The United Kingdom is another close partner in the  North Atlantic based on Canada’s deep partnership   with the country and their historic ties and shared values.  The 2 countries enjoy a close-knit defence partnership   and they cooperate on shared priorities in the Arctic   including on climate change and research through   the Canada–Inuit Nunangat–United Kingdom Arctic   Research Programme.    Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  32  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy The\\tNorth\\tPacific  Canada’s Indo-Pacific Strategy recognizes that several  Indo-Pacific states are looking to the Arctic as a region  of opportunity and as a means through which to engage  with Canada.  The strategy recognizes the North Pacific as part of  Canada’s neighbourhood. The North Pacific  through  the Bering Strait  is one of the key approaches to the  North American Arctic. Canada must not undervalue the  strategic importance of these approaches—Canada’s  adversaries do not underestimate them. In line with the  strategy  Canada will explore ways to deepen Arctic  cooperation with key North Pacific states on issues of  mutual interest while also responding to the emerging  challenges some may represent.  While Canada is pleased to engage with Indo-Pacific  states making positive contributions in the Arctic accord- ing to the principles for engagement with non-Arctic  states  Canada will closely scrutinize activities of states  whose ambitions or activities are potentially counter to  Canadian values  interests or objectives in the region.  In addition to Canada’s long-standing partnership with the  United States on Arctic issues  focus will be given to increasing  cooperation with other key partners in the region—Japan and the  Republic of Korea—given the mutual long-standing relationships  and shared values of the 3 nations.  Canada will work through established forums and mechanisms   such as the Arctic Council  the Canada-Japan Action Plan for  Contributing to a Free and Open Indo-Pacific Region and the  Canada-Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership  to identify  concrete opportunities to deepen cooperation between the   4 countries on shared priorities  such as maritime security   science and technology  trade and sustainable economic   development and fisheries.  33  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Leadership on Arctic governance  and multilateral challenges  Despite\\texceedingly\\tdifficult\\trelations\\twith\\tRussia \\tArctic\\tstates\\t  continue to preside over a well-governed region operating under   extensive national and international legal frameworks.

Reinforcing      the Arctic    Council  Canada is firmly committed to the enduring value of the  Arctic Council and is adhering to its established Rules  of Procedure. Canada remains focused on continuing  the council’s important work for the benefit of the Arctic  region and the people living there  including   Indigenous Peoples.    Since 2021  our Global Arctic Leadership Initiative has  funded the establishment of a permanent secretariat  of the Arctic Council’s Sustainable Development   Working Group in Canada and provided over $2 million  in funding for more than 25 Arctic Council initiatives  with national  civil society and Indigenous partners.   The Arctic Council exists thanks in part to Canadian and  Indigenous leadership. Canada will not allow Russia’s  actions to undermine the integrity or functionality of this  important body. The people of the Arctic  who benefit so  deeply from the important work of the council  should  not be made to suffer because of Russia’s choices.     We will increase our contributions to the Arctic Council to allow for more Canadian  engagement and leadership in council projects and greater institutional support for the  council  as well as provide funding for innovative Indigenous and youth ideas in the council.  This support is critically important as the council continues to increase its activities.  Canada will increase its leadership in the council in preparation for Canada’s third chairship  of the Arctic Council  from 2029 to 2031. Working with Canadian and Arctic Council  partners  Canada will meaningfully engage the Permanent Participants from Canada   territorial and provincial governments of Canada and other Indigenous partners on the  planning and development of Canada’s Arctic Council chairship program.   Those essential building blocks will also provide guidance on how Canada engages in  other international polar processes  such as the International Polar Year: 2032 to 2033  which  is an opportunity to showcase Canada’s leadership through scientific and technological  achievements  as well as by amplifying Indigenous Peoples’ voices and   their rich knowledge.  35  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Addressing regional     and global challenges  i.  Climate change and environmental protection  While the triple crisis of climate change  biodiversity   loss and pollution is a global problem that requires  urgent collective action  the impacts of this triple crisis  are disproportionately felt by northerners. Canada has  taken a dual-track approach to addressing these issues   with engagement at the multilateral level through the  UN system and at the regional level through   the Arctic Council.  In addition to robust domestic measures to address  climate change  Canada is also working with international  partners to boost global efforts to achieve the Paris  Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C to avoid   the most devastating impacts for the world    including the Arctic.  Cutting emissions of black carbon is the most powerful  action to take to slow the pace of near-term warming in  the Arctic. For this reason  Arctic states agreed to   collectively reduce emissions of black carbon by 25%   to 33% of 2013 levels by 2025. Canada is on track to do   its part in achieving this collective goal.  Canada is also doing its part to address biodiversity loss  and advance conservation domestically and globally.  Canada continues to work toward conserving 30%   of its lands and oceans by 2030. A large part of   Canada’s protected and conserved areas fall within   Canada’s Arctic and North  and many are being   co-managed with Indigenous Peoples.6   To increase cohesiveness  we will continue to leverage  our diplomatic resources in support of all government  efforts led by Environment and Climate Change  Canada in the UN system to ensure implementation  of the historic Paris Agreement  of the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change  and of the  Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework  under the Convention on Biological Diversity.   Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  6 Final Report of the National Advisory Panel on Marine Protected Area Standards   36  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Canada’s ambassador for climate change will continue to advocate for international  partners to join Canada-led initiatives on phasing out coal; reducing short-lived climate  pollutants; finalizing a global treaty to end plastic pollution; protecting more of nature; and  other related initiatives. The ambassador will also continue to promote any other diplomatic  initiatives that address climate change. The Arctic ambassador will support this work.  Additionally  in the context of the Arctic Council’s initiatives on climate change  Canada will  continue its ongoing work at a regional level to develop scientific assessments on the  impacts of climate change and the state of biodiversity in the Arctic; to reduce short-lived  climate pollutants in the Arctic region; to encourage the use and development of renewable  energy in remote Arctic communities to exchange knowledge and implement solutions  on wildfires and climate change adaptation in an Arctic context; to develop a pan-Arctic  network of marine protected areas; and to implement the regional action plan on marine  litter in the Arctic.  Elsewhere  we will encourage all allies to join NATO’s Climate Change and Security  Centre of Excellence  which is based in Montréal. Working with the Department of  National Defence  we will also leverage the centre’s expertise to promote research and  knowledge sharing on climate security threats in the Arctic and elsewhere.

This  imposes a responsibility on Canada to ensure that the  area is well managed. Canada is collaborating closely  with fellow Arctic Ocean coastal states and other   interested parties to implement the Central Arctic Ocean  Fisheries Agreement  which established a precautionary  16-year ban on commercial fishing on the high seas of  the Arctic Ocean  as well as a program for joint scientific  research and monitoring that includes Indigenous  Knowledge as a vital component to ensure that the best  available knowledge is used in decision making. Canada  is also ensuring that Inuit in Canada continue to be part  of this process.  Canada is also prioritizing the protection of the marine  environment in the Arctic Ocean in cooperation with  its like-minded international and Indigenous partners.  Canada maintains an indefinite moratorium on offshore  oil and gas development in its Arctic waters. Canada  also supports  in the absence of both a comprehensive  understanding of seabed mining’s environmental  impacts and a robust regulatory regime  a moratorium  on commercial seabed mining in areas beyond national  jurisdiction  including in the central Arctic Ocean.  Canada is committed to reinforcing rules-based  approaches in the Arctic Ocean.  We will work with other departments and agencies   to continue to develop and implement international  measures to promote safe and responsible shipping  in the Arctic  including by supporting efforts at the IMO  and the Arctic Council that complement the International  Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (known as the  “Polar Code”) and the ban on heavy fuel oil   in Arctic waters.    Across all areas of Canada’s multilateral cooperation   in the UN system  at the Arctic Council and under   the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement  it is   imperative that Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples  be meaningfully engaged in discussions when their  rights or interests could be potentially impacted.  We will continue to provide funding  to Indigenous Permanent Participant  organizations in Canada to engage  in this work. We will also advocate   alongside Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples  for the equal  treatment and inclusion of Indigenous  Knowledge and science.  In support of Fisheries and Oceans  Canada  we undertake to advocate  for the development of marine  protected areas and other effective  conservation measures in the central  Arctic Ocean under the Arctic Council   thereby enabling Arctic states to lead  by example in implementing the  UN agreement on marine biological  diversity in areas beyond   national jurisdiction.  38  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Adopting a more inclusive  approach to Arctic diplomacy  1.\\tEnsuring\\tArctic\\tdiplomacy\\tis\\tinformed\\tby\\tand\\tbenefits\\tArctic\\t   and northern Indigenous Peoples and other northerners   The Arctic is home to more than 4 million people   including Indigenous Peoples who have inhabited the  region for thousands of years. Canada is committed to  a more inclusive approach to this foreign policy that  ensures people living in the North  including Indigenous  peoples  can participate in international decision making  on matters that affect their rights or interests.  Arctic diplomacy should be informed by and benefit  Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples and other  northerners. We remain committed to this goal and  will strengthen our efforts in this area  building on the  approach adopted in the ANPF to remain open to  holding discussions within more appropriate   distinctions-based frameworks  like the Inuit-Crown   Partnership Committee.   To move forward  Canada acknowledges the damaging  impacts of colonialism on the Indigenous Peoples   of Canada’s Arctic and North. Grounded in a commitment  to reconciliation  this policy seeks to build in the Arctic  foreign policy space a renewed Inuit-Crown and   nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous Peoples  based on the recognition of rights  respect  cooperation   and partnership.  Our work on this foreign policy will be guided by the  United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous  Peoples; treaties  including land claims agreements;  self-government agreements with Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples; and the Inuit Nunangat Policy.7  Canada’s Arctic foreign policy will also be guided  by respect for territorial and provincial jurisdiction   including the devolution agreements with the Northwest  Territories  Nunavut and the Yukon.  7\\t The\\tInuit\\tNunangat\\tPolicy\\trecognizes\\tInuit\\tNunangat\\tas\\ta\\tdistinct\\tgeographic \\tcultural\\tand\\tpolitical\\tregion\\tthat\\tforms\\t40%\\tof\\tCanada’s\\tland\\tarea \\t  \\t nearly\\tthree-quarters\\tof\\tits\\tcoastline\\tand\\tsignificant\\toffshore\\tareas.\\tIt\\talso\\tacknowledges\\tInuit\\tTreaty\\tOrganizations’\\tright\\tto\\trepresent\\tthemselves\\tnationally\\t  \\t and\\tinternationally\\tand\\tthat\\tstructurally\\tthey\\tmay\\tchoose\\tInuit\\tTapiriit\\tKanatami\\tand\\tthe\\tInuit\\tCircumpolar\\tCouncil\\tto\\trepresent\\tInuit\\tat\\tthe\\tnational\\t  \\t and\\tinternational\\tlevels\\trespectively.  39  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy i.  Arctic ambassador  The geopolitical landscape in the Arctic has become increasingly complex  and competitive. To ensure that the Canadian Arctic remains a region that  is stable  prosperous and secure  we need to deepen our engagement with  like-minded states  as well as with territorial and provincial governments   Indigenous Peoples and other domestic partners.  To lead this effort  we will establish the position of Arctic ambassador.  The ambassador’s responsibilities will include making linkages between domestic issues  and those relating to Canada’s foreign affairs; serving as Canada’s Senior Arctic Official and  advancing Canada’s polar interests in multilateral forums; engaging with counterparts in  Arctic and non-Arctic states  as well as with Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic; and raising  awareness internationally of Indigenous rights in the Arctic context. The ambassador will  also support the work of Global Affairs Canada and other departments on Arctic research  security.  In carrying out these duties  the ambassador will work closely with Arctic and  northern Indigenous Peoples  territorial and provincial governments and other northerners.   The ambassador will serve as a representative in our diplomatic corps and distinguish  himself or herself by ensuring that the Arctic Foreign Policy remains connected to the reality  of Canadians living in the Arctic. The ambassador will also play an important role in Canada’s  broader efforts toward reconciliation. The ambassador will have an office in Canada’s North.

Northern and Indigenous diplomacy      on the world stage  Canada remains committed to providing international  platforms for northerners  including territorial  provincial  and Indigenous partners and youths  to engage in and to  represent their own international Arctic views  especially  on issues that impact their rights or jurisdiction. Canada  also welcomes made-in-the-North initiatives to support  homegrown policy development that enhances northern  and Indigenous diplomacy on the world stage.    a. Sub-national governments  Arctic and northern public governments play a strategic  role in Canada’s Arctic diplomacy efforts. Canada  remains committed to including territorial government  officials in the Canadian delegation to Arctic   Council meetings.     b.  Arctic and northern Indigenous diplomacy  The Arctic Foreign Policy recommits to enhancing the  representation and participation of Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples in relevant negotiations and  international forums  such as the Arctic Council and the  United Nations  including the UN Permanent Forum on  Indigenous Issues  and all other bodies that Arctic and  northern Indigenous Peoples judge to affect them.  We have heard clearly from Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners that they are looking for more than  a platform where they are only one voice consulted  among many. Instead  Indigenous partners require and  demand meaningful continuous engagement to actively  partake in and shape decision making at the international  level that reflects their roles as rights holders. We will   uphold the role of Arctic and northern Indigenous   Peoples as active partners in the conduct of interna- tional relations in the Arctic and support their efforts   to advance this goal.  The Arctic Athabaskan Council  Gwich’in Council   International and the Inuit Circumpolar Council currently  sit at the Arctic Council as Permanent Participants   with membership from Canada.  Since 2020  Canada has increased funding to the   3 Permanent Participants in Canada  allowing each of  them to receive up to $650 000 each year. This support  is strengthening Indigenous voices in international Arctic  matters  particularly at the Arctic Council.  With Transport Canada  we will  support opportunities for the Inuit  Circumpolar Council Canada to  represent Inuit Knowledge and  perspectives in international forums   including on Arctic shipping and  environmental matters at the IMO.  Canada will also support similar efforts by other Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples to increase their  representation at relevant international forums to  ensure their rights and perspectives inform decision  making at the global level. Canada will work with   Indigenous partners to identify possible ways of   improving the capacity and role of Indigenous Peoples   in international Arctic affairs.   Canada remains strongly committed to the ANPF’s  objective of providing Arctic and northern youths with  additional opportunities to participate in  and benefit  from  Canada’s international Arctic agenda. We have  leveraged support for UArctic (an international network  of universities  colleges  research institutes and other  organizations concerned with education and research in  and about the Arctic) to provide opportunities for Canadi- ans to study in different parts of the circumpolar Arctic  to  generate regional solutions and to support collaboration  in Indigenous research and education.  41  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Photos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  iii. Northern and Indigenous representation      at Global Affairs Canada  Indigenous Peoples and northerners are   underrepresented at Global Affairs Canada  and   sustained efforts are needed to boost recruitment   and retention.  In line with the Future of Diplomacy  the department is  developing a new external recruitment strategy that will  be launched in 2025. The strategy will support outreach  across Canada to identify Canadians with the skills   needed to deliver on our various mandates and will  include specific outreach to under-represented   communities  including among Indigenous Peoples   and northerners.  To support our recruitment efforts and  increase Indigenous perspectives in the  department  we will establish a paid  Arctic and northern Indigenous youth  internship program that will consider  the need of Arctic and northern  Indigenous youths to remain close   to their families and communities   and ensure that appropriate support   is in place.  We will also work with partners to  identify other avenues for increasing  the representation of Indigenous  Peoples and northerners at Global  Affairs Canada.   42  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Advancing Indigenous    and northern foreign    policy priorities  Broadening Canada’s international engagement to   contribute more directly to domestic issues  such as  closing socio-economic gaps  supporting infrastructure  development  enhancing knowledge of the North    protecting the Arctic environment and advancing   reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples  remains a priority.  Key issues include those described below.  i.  Cross-border mobility  First Nations  Inuit and Métis communities in Canada’s  Arctic and North share long-standing spiritual  cultural   political  economic  social and family connections with  Indigenous communities in the United States and Green- land. The introduction of modern international borders  and the associated controls on cross-border mobility  have negatively impacted Indigenous Peoples’ ability  to maintain familial  economic and cultural ties and  traditional practices.  Photos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  Canada has been working with  Indigenous partners and the United  States  Denmark and Greenland to find  solutions to address border crossing  and migration challenges faced by First  Nations  Inuit and Métis Peoples.   This commitment is reflected in Action  Plan Measure Shared Priorities 52 of the  Action Plan to implement the United  Nations Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples Act.   To address border mobility challenges  faced by First Nations  Inuit and Métis  Peoples who live in the United States   including Alaska  Canada intends  to bring forward legislation and  regulatory measures.  43  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii.   Market access  Indigenous Peoples also face unjustifiable barriers to  trade—barriers that also restrict international market  access to Indigenous-harvested and -produced goods   such as seal fur and ivory products.  The traditional harvesting of seals and other species by  Inuit and other Indigenous Peoples of Canada is both  a sustainable and a valuable contributor to Arctic and  northern communities. Trade barriers by key partners   such as the United States  the European Union and other  countries  have a broad detrimental impact on life in  Canada’s remote Arctic and northern communities.  In August 2024  Canada submitted  a response to the European  Commission’s review of its regulation  on the trade of seal products. Canada  requested that the European Union  repeal its regulations and replace  them with rules that offer access   to ethically and sustainably   harvested products.  Canada will continue to advocate  for a repeal of the seal product ban.  We will also promote awareness of  sustainable seal products and harvest  management by hosting officials-level  dialogues with Arctic countries and  Indigenous partners at our missions   to the European Union and the   United States.

Indigenous Knowledge and participation  Canada supports Indigenous advocacy against pervasive  colonial approaches to Arctic science and research   which marginalize and discredit Indigenous Knowledge  and participation.  iv. Indigenous languages  Indigenous languages such as Inuktut8 are essential to  the preservation of Indigenous culture and the well-  being of Indigenous Peoples and communities. Canada  will therefore enhance its efforts to work with its Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners to facilitate the  exchange of knowledge and best practices related   to Indigenous language assessment  monitoring   and revitalization.  We will continue to support  equitable research partnerships  at the international level between  Indigenous and non-Indigenous  researchers  such as the Canada–Inuit  Nunangat–United Kingdom Arctic  Research Programme.  Looking forward  we will continue  to contribute to federal efforts on  a broader range of northern and  Indigenous priorities  and we will  collaborate with Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners  territorial  and provincial governments and  other northerners on international  advocacy as appropriate. This includes  promoting investment in critical  minerals development; transportation;  energy and electrification; broadband  connectivity; cultural diplomacy; and  the conservation of the Porcupine  caribou herd. We will also work with  Indigenous partners  Canadian Heritage  and other relevant government  departments to advocate for the  repatriation from across the globe of  artifacts originating from First Nations   Inuit and Métis communities.  8\\t Inuktut\\tis\\tthe\\tfirst\\tlanguage\\tused\\tin\\tInuit\\tNunaat \\tand\\tthe\\tmajority\\tof\\tInuit\\tNunaat\\tresidents\\tcontinue\\tto\\tspeak\\tInuktut\\tas\\ttheir\\tfirst \\tonly\\tor\\tpreferred\\tlanguage.\\t  \\t Therefore \\tto\\tuphold\\tthe\\tinherent\\tdignity\\tof\\tInuit \\tsupporting\\tInuktut\\tin\\tthis\\tcontext\\tas\\ta\\tfirst\\tor\\tlater\\tlanguage\\taligns\\twith\\tthe\\tbroader\\tpurposes\\tof \\tamong\\t  \\t other\\tthings \\tworking\\tin\\tpartnership\\tto\\tdemonstrate\\tand\\tpromote\\tshared\\trespect\\tfor\\tthe\\thistory\\tand\\timportance\\tof\\tInuktut\\tand\\tfor\\tsocio-economic\\t  \\t and\\tcultural\\tdevelopment.  45  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy v.   Supporting northern and Indigenous      trade and export  In line with Canada’s inclusive approach to trade and   its Export Diversification Strategy  we are committed   to supporting northern and Indigenous exporters in   accessing global markets.  The Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) recognizes that  building strong relationships with our northern and  Indigenous partners is key to this mission. Dedicated  trade commissioners  based in regional offices for British  Columbia and the Yukon; Alberta and the Northwest   Territories; Quebec and Nunavut; Manitoba and  Saskatchewan; and Atlantic Canada  work closely with  Canadian businesses in the Arctic and northern regions  to support their global expansion. The TCS network  also continues to actively support and develop tailored  programming for northern and Indigenous exporters   including through business delegations and export  training and accelerator programs  among other ways.  Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) into northern  and Indigenous communities will also play a vital role in  economic and infrastructure development in the region.  Through our increasing engagement with Northern and  Indigenous communities via the CanExport Community  Investments program  we will continue to support  municipalities and economic development organizations  in seeking and retaining FDI in the North while ensuring  that Canada’s environmental and national security   interests are protected.    3.  Transforming Global    \\tAffairs\\tCanada’s\\tdomestic\\t   engagement processes  We are committed to pursuing an ongoing collaborative  approach to domestic engagement that is informed by  early  sustained and meaningful engagement with   territorial and provincial governments  Arctic and   northern Indigenous governments and organizations   and northerners more generally.  46  The Arctic Cooperation Advisory  Committee is a Canadian forum  for the engagement of relevant  federal departments  territorial  and provincial governments and  Permanent Participant partners on the  development and implementation of  Canada’s international Arctic policy   including Arctic-Council-related  matters. It will remain an important  mechanism for dialogue and  engagement on the development and  implementation of Canada’s Arctic  Foreign Policy.   We are committed to exploring  distinctions-based engagements with  First Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty  and Self-Governing Partners from  Canada’s Arctic and North.  For example  we are committed to  engaging directly with Inuit through the  Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee as  we apply the Inuit Nunangat Policy to  our programs  policies and services.  In addition  we will expand  opportunities for territorial and  provincial governments and Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners to  join or support Canadian delegations  at bilateral or international Arctic  meetings and treaty negotiations if  in  such meetings and negotiations  their  rights or interests could potentially   be impacted.   We will also continue to provide a  critical coordination function for  multi-stakeholder Arctic events to  support a strong Canadian presence.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy CONCLUSION  The Arctic is a region of tremendous opportunity thanks  to its plentiful resources and resilient people.   However  Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine  rapidly   advancing climate change and increasing interest in  the Arctic from non-Arctic states has led to increased  competition and geopolitical tension in the region.   To ensure that the Arctic remains stable  prosperous and  secure and to fully implement the objectives laid out  in the International chapter of the ANPF  Canada needs  a diplomatic strategy that responds to this evolving  geopolitical context.  The Arctic Foreign Policy reorients Canada’s approach  to the Arctic based on a clear-eyed assessment of the  threats Canada faces today  and those it anticipates in  the future. It aligns Canada’s foreign and defence policy  to ensure the security of Canadians and ensures that  together with its allies  Canada can guard against and  defend itself against threats from its adversaries   in the Arctic.  By reinforcing the pillars of Arctic governance and the  principles of the rules-based international order  this  policy will help to safeguard the collective interests   of the peoples of the Arctic from those who would   seek to impose their wills.   This policy will strengthen our relationships with   territorial and provincial governments  Arctic and   northern Indigenous governments and organizations   and other northerners. It will produce new and more  effective ways of working together on Arctic diplomacy  that will transform Canada’s approach   to international engagement.  Canadian diplomacy has a role to play in building  renewed relationships with First Nations  Inuit  Métis   Modern Treaty and Self-Governing Partners; relationships  that are based on the recognition of rights  respect   and partnership.  The Arctic Foreign Policy is built on a vision of shared  cooperation and prosperity for all the peoples of the  Arctic who are committed to peace and stability.   Together  we can realize this future and ensure Canada’s  place as a leader in the Arctic for generations to come.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  47  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Annex: Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   development process and Canada’s Arctic   and\\tNorthern\\tPolicy\\tFramework\\t(ANPF) \\t  published in 2019  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   development process  In the spirit of the principle of “nothing about us without  us ” the Arctic Foreign Policy was developed on the basis  of extensive and distinctions-based engagement and  on collaboration and cooperation with domestic rights  holders from Canada’s Arctic and North  including First  Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-Governing  Partners and organizations; the territorial governments  (the Northwest Territories  Nunavut and the Yukon);  and provincial governments (Manitoba  Newfoundland  and Labrador and Quebec). We engaged partners in a  variety of formats  including bilateral meetings  regional  round-table discussions and ANPF   governance mechanisms.  The Arctic Foreign Policy is guided by all relevant  treaties and self-government agreements with Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners  including obligations  Canada has to Indigenous Peoples under those treaties  and agreements  and the rights recognized and affirmed  under section 35 of the Constitution Act  1982. It is further  guided by the Yukon Northern Affairs Program   Devolution Transfer Agreement (2003)  the Northwest  Territories Devolution Agreement (2014)  the United  Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  (endorsed by Canada in 2020)  the Inuit Nunangat Policy  (2022) and the Nunavut Lands and Resources Devolution   Agreement (2024).  The policy development process was also informed by  engagement with like-minded Arctic states; specifically   the Kingdom of Denmark  Finland  Iceland  Norway   Sweden and the United States.    48  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   Canada’s ANPF  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy complements and  supports the implementation of the ANPF  which was  published in 2019. The ANPF was co-developed with  over 25 First Nations  Inuit and Métis governments and  organizations  as well as with territorial and   provincial governments.   The ANPF sets out a common vision of a future where  Arctic and northern peoples are thriving  strong and  safe. The framework includes a co-developed policy  statement and the whole-of-government International  chapter  which articulates Canada’s goals and objectives  for the circumpolar Arctic in 3 key areas that   remain in effect:  1. Strengthening the rules-based   international order in the Arctic   2. More clearly defining Canada’s    Arctic boundaries   3. Broadening Canada’s international    engagement to contribute to the priorities   of the Canadian Arctic   The implementation of the International chapter has  been supported by Global Affairs Canada’s Global   Arctic Leadership Initiative with an annual budget   of $7 million each year to strengthen Canada’s global   leadership in the Arctic.  The ANPF’s Safety  security and defence chapter also  underlines the importance of strengthening cooperation  with international partners on safety  security   and defence issues.  Canada remains committed to strengthening Arctic   and northern infrastructure and to closing infrastructure  gaps with other regions of Canada to forge opportunities   for economic development  to address reconciliation    to increase resilience and to contribute to Arctic defence  and security.

It also   complements  and benefits from  the historic investments  Canada is making in its national defence and security  through its 2024 defence policy update Our North    Strong and Free.   It will make Canada more secure  especially for Canadians  living in the North. It will support strong and resilient Arctic  and Northern communities. It will also serve to advance the  interests and priorities of Indigenous Peoples and   northerners who call the Arctic home.  Canada’s new policy is based on a shared vision of the   Arctic’s future; I am confident Canada will realize its   ambitions through this policy.  The Honourable Mélanie Joly  P.C.  M.P.  Minister of Foreign Affairs  Canada is at an inflection point in the Arctic.   For many years  Canada has aimed to manage the Arctic  and northern regions cooperatively with other states as a  zone of low tension that is free from military competition  This approach had significant benefits  uniting the Arctic  nations to advance cooperation on issues of common  interest  such as sustainable development  environmental  protection and scientific collaboration  including through   the establishment of the Arctic Council in Ottawa in 1996.  However  the guardrails that we have depended on to  prevent and resolve conflict have weakened. Russia’s illegal  war in Ukraine has made cooperation with it on Arctic issues  exceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future. Uncertainty  and unpredictability are creating economic consequences  that Canadians are facing everyday.  Threats to Canada’s security are no longer bound by  geography; climate change is accelerating rapidly; and  non-Arctic states  including China  are also seeking greater  influence in the governance of the Arctic. To respond   Canada must be strong in the North American Arctic  and  it requires deeper collaboration with its greatest ally  the  United States. Canada must also maintain strong ties with   its 5 Nordic allies  which are now also all NATO members.  The evolving security and political dynamics in the   Arctic have triggered a need for a recalibrated diplomatic  approach to advancing Canada’s national interests in the  region  based on the principles of pragmatic diplomacy.   The Arctic Foreign Policy  a diplomatic strategy  addresses  the challenges and opportunities Canada faces today  as  well as those it expects to face in the coming decades. It  gives Canada the diplomatic tools it needs to continue to  assert its sovereignty  advance its national security interests  and promote a stable  prosperous and secure Arctic.   This policy is built on  and benefits from  the knowledge  and perspectives of Indigenous Peoples who call the Arctic  home. It comes from a place of understanding that there is  a dark chapter in Government of Canada policy in the Arctic   which includes forced relocations of Inuit to the High Arctic  and other colonial policies. These have inflicted significant  intergenerational trauma on Indigenous Peoples.   2  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Foreword: Message from   the\\tMinister\\tof\\tNorthern\\tAffairs  The new Arctic Foreign Policy will expand and broaden  Canada’s international engagement  strengthen relations  with our international partners and exercise Canada’s   sovereignty in the Canadian Arctic. It will also advance  domestic priorities  including enhancing knowledge of   the North  protecting the Arctic environment  and   advancing reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples   throughout the North.   By placing the invaluable perspectives  knowledge  and  wisdom of Indigenous Peoples in the North  who have  called the Arctic home since time immemorial  at the  foreground this new policy and its implementation  we will  ensure that the Arctic remains a vibrant  prosperous  and  secure region now and for future generations.  The Honourable Dan Vandal  P.C.  M.P.  Minister of Northern Affairs  Released in 2019  the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework  (‘the Framework’) was co-developed with over 25 First  Nations  Inuit  and Métis governments  organizations   and territorial and provincial governments. It laid out a  shared vision to ensure that the needs and priorities of the  North remain paramount: “Strong  self-reliant people and  communities working together for a vibrant  prosperous and  sustainable Arctic and northern region at home and abroad   while expressing Canada’s enduring Arctic sovereignty.”   The launch of Canada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy builds on  the International Chapter of the Framework and is a pivotal  moment in the realization of our shared vision for the Arctic.  Informed by engagements with Indigenous Peoples and  Northerners and their vast knowledge in the region  as well  as with territorial and provincial governments  this Policy  reflects the federal government’s international approach to  the Arctic to ensure that Canada remains well-positioned   as an Arctic leader.   The Arctic Foreign Policy will promote a safe  strong    and thriving future for those who live in the Arctic and   the North  while protecting Canada’s enduring Arctic   sovereignty. It considers the shifting geopolitical context  and puts forward plans to ensure that the Canadian Arctic  remains strong and adaptable on the international stage   now and into the future. Just as Indigenous partners are  instrumental in the ongoing implementation of the   Framework  the success of this new foreign policy will  depend on continued learning from the immeasurable  experience  knowledge  and wisdom of First Nations  Inuit   Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-Governing partners and  communities. This shared learning is critical to a strong and  sustainable Arctic and to the full and effective implemen- tation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples Act.   Through this Policy  Canada’s approach to the Arctic will be  developed with respect for Indigenous self-determination  and the values  interests  cultures  and traditions of Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples  including weaving   traditional knowledge into Arctic decision-making   at the global level.   3  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Foreword: Message from   the Minister of National Defence  Canada remains committed to contributing to NATO   and NORAD’s awareness of the threat environment across  the Arctic region  including in the North American Arctic.   We likewise support the continued leadership of   like-minded Arctic states on matters of security   and defence.  The Arctic security and continental defence investments  made in Our North  Strong and Free and NORAD   Modernization support NATO’s deterrence and   defence agenda by protecting the Alliance’s Northern   and Western flanks. It ensures that Canada can engage   in the world and deploy from a secure base in support   of NATO allies  when needed.  As we expand and enhance our presence in the Arctic  we  recognize that this will also impact the communities who  inhabit the region. Indigenous Peoples have called the  Arctic home since time immemorial  and working with them  will enhance the prosperity and defence of the region.   Our government will continue to prioritize working with   Indigenous communities in the Arctic and deepening   our relationship with them.  As the world continues to evolve and threats intensify    the connection between foreign policy and defence policy  must remain strong for the protection of our country   and our values. This Arctic Foreign Policy complements  Canada’s ongoing work in the region to expand our   presence and safeguard our sovereignty in the Arctic.   The Honourable William Sterling Blair  P.C.  C.O.M.  M.P.  Minister of National Defence  Canada has benefited enormously from our geography.  Surrounded by 3 oceans  and our closest ally to the south   our country has enjoyed a degree of protection that has  helped keep our borders safe and secure. That reality is  changing in the Arctic. Where the polar ice caps provided  physical protection  the region is now opening to the world  as it warms at 4 times the global average.  In the coming decades  the Arctic Ocean will become a vital  shipping route between Europe and Asia  while vast stores  of natural resources become increasingly accessible.   This growing access is already enticing nations to   the region  heightening security challenges and   geopolitical competition.   Canada must urgently strengthen our presence in the Arctic  and northern regions as our adversaries aspire to a greater  role in the region’s affairs. The physical threat of climate  change is compounded by challenges from authoritarian  states to the rules-based international order that Canada  and its allies strive to uphold. Simultaneously  the character  of conflict is changing with rapid technological and   cyber advances.     Canada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy responds to these  growing challenges by focusing on 3 key areas: asserting  Canada’s sovereignty  advancing our interests in the region   and promoting a stable  prosperous  and secure North.   The policy addresses current needs and challenges while   anticipating how the region will change in the coming  decades. It also provides the diplomatic tools we need  to partner with Northern communities to assert Canada’s  sovereignty and to support Arctic and Northern people   so that they can thrive and remain secure.  The Arctic Foreign Policy complements the work and   investments outlined in our new defence policy update   Our North  Strong and Free  which was developed in part as  a response to the emerging threats in the Arctic and around  the world. Our North  Strong and Free focuses on   Canadian values and strengths while underpinning   our Arctic and Northern sovereignty  strengthening our   diplomatic influence  and leveraging our world-leading  cyber and space talent. It reinforces our capabilities and  capacity in the region  in partnership with those   who live there.  4  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Executive summary  Canada is an Arctic nation.  Canada launched the co-developed Arctic and Northern  Policy Framework (ANPF) in 2019  which sets out a   common vision of the Arctic and the North  in which   the peoples there are thriving  strong and secure.   Since then  strategic competition has intensified across the  globe as major powers that do not share Canadian interests  and values seek to shape the international environment to  their advantage. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022   for example  has shaken the foundations of international  cooperation in the Arctic.   At the same time  the Arctic is experiencing the   considerable impacts of climate change  with significant   implications for the security of the communities and people  who live in the Arctic. By 2050  the Arctic Ocean will become  an increasingly viable shipping route between Europe and  Asia during the summer.  More than ever  the Arctic is a theatre of interest for many  non-Arctic states and actors aspiring for a greater role in  Arctic affairs. Canada’s adversaries also try to achieve   influence through non-military tactics  including cyber  activities  foreign interference and economic coercion.  The North American Arctic is no longer free from tension.  Canada must work even closer with its closest ally  the   United States  to maintain a secure North American  homeland. Canada should also be closer than ever   to its Nordic allies.  To respond to these emerging geopolitical dynamics   and to align more closely with the defence policy update   Our North  Strong and Free  Canada has developed  in   partnership with northern and Indigenous Peoples  the  Arctic Foreign Policy to supplement the International   chapter of the ANPF. This policy will help ensure that the  Arctic remains a stable  prosperous and secure region   for future generations.  The Arctic Foreign Policy provides new funding over   the next 5 years to ensure that Global Affairs Canada1   is fit-for-purpose in the Arctic. The policy also benefits   Canadians who live in the Arctic and in the North    including by strengthening their ties and connections   across borders.   To achieve its objective of a stable  prosperous and secure  Arctic  Canada will continue to assert its sovereignty. Canada  will also advance its national interests through pragmatic  diplomacy; lead on Arctic governance and multilateral  challenges; and adopt a more inclusive approach   to Arctic diplomacy.  As part of this policy  Canada will:    appoint an Arctic ambassador     open a new consulate in Anchorage  Alaska    open a new consulate in Nuuk  Greenland    initiate an Arctic security dialogue with the ministers   of foreign affairs of like-minded states in the Arctic    expand information sharing with relevant territorial and  provincial governments and Indigenous leaders on  emerging and developing international Arctic security  trends  including foreign interference threats    support science and research coordination initiatives   with foreign policy considerations as related to research  security and science in the Arctic     launch boundary negotiations with the United States   regarding the Beaufort Sea and finalize the implementa- tion of the boundary agreement between Canada   and the Kingdom of Denmark regarding Tartupaluk   (Hans Island)  Canada remains deeply committed to the full implementa- tion of the ANPF  to Arctic state primacy and to upholding  the rules-based international order2 in the Arctic. The Arctic  Foreign Policy will provide new tools for Canada to deliver  on the objectives set out in the ANPF in a changing   geopolitical context.  This foreign policy will secure its national interests   and ensure stability and prosperity for the Indigenous   Peoples who live in the Arctic and the North—including   First Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-  Governing Partners—and other northerners. Canada’s  diplomacy is stronger when it is informed by Indigenous  Knowledge  culture and practices  as well as by the lived  experiences of northerners who call the Arctic home.  1\\t Hereafter \\tall\\tuses\\tof\\tthe\\tfirst-person\\tplural—we \\tus \\tour\\tand\\tours—are\\tin\\treference\\tto\\tGlobal\\tAffairs\\tCanada.  2\\tThe\\trules-based\\tinternational\\torder\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tis\\tthe\\tsum\\tof\\tinternational\\trules \\tnorms\\tand\\tinstitutions\\tthat\\tgovern\\tinternational\\taffairs\\tthere.  5  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy STRATEGIC  CHALLENGES   IN THE ARCTIC  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  6  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 1.  Russia     since 2022  Canada has been clear that there will be no business as usual with Russia  at the Arctic  Council or elsewhere  since its illegal  full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally changed the geopolitical  landscape  with spillover effects in the Arctic. It is an attack not only against Ukraine   but also on the fundamental principles of international relations  including respect   for sovereignty  territorial integrity and international law.   In addition to the existential threat Russian aggression poses to Ukraine and its people   Russian president Putin’s war on Ukraine risks setting a broader post-Cold-War   precedent that borders can be redrawn through violence.  Northerners understand how close a neighbour Russia is. Canada must be clear-eyed  about the implications of its geographic proximity to Russia. Canadian Forces Station  Alert  on Ellesmere Island  Nunavut  is closer to the Russian military’s air force base   at Nagurskoye  Russia  than Iqaluit is to Ottawa or Toronto is to Winnipeg.   For over a decade  Russia has invested in modernizing its Arctic infrastructure and its  military capabilities in the Arctic to develop resources and control access to the region   with particular emphasis on its own western region and approaches. It is looking to  profit from climate change in the region and will continue promoting the development  of the Northern Sea Route as a major international shipping route. Given the strategic  importance Russia places on its Arctic region  Canada expects these activities   will continue.  Russia has also intensified its disinformation campaigns  conducted below-threshold  military activities3  and crafted a vehement domestic narrative of a “hostile  unfriendly  West ” in part to justify its own militarization of the Arctic.   Russia’s historic posture has been to ensure sovereignty and control over its own Arctic  region and to limit the role of non-Arctic states in Arctic affairs. However  because of  sanctions and of its massive expenditures on its illegal war against Ukraine  Russia  is increasingly reliant on China to fund and support the development of its projects  in the Arctic. These include investments in Arctic research  oil and gas development   ports and other critical infrastructure. We anticipate this trend will continue and lead to  increased activity by China in the Russian Arctic.   Russia and China are aligned in their desire to undermine the liberal-rules-based  international system  but the power asymmetry between them often highlights the  divergence in their interests. Russia is increasingly dependent on China and is reversing  its historic posture by opening its Arctic to China. For instance  in July 2024  Russia and  China  building on their 2022 statement to cooperate in the Arctic  conducted joint  military exercises in the Russian High North. In addition  Russian and Chinese warships  have conducted joint patrols in international waters off the Aleutian Islands; the   2 countries’ coast guards have conducted joint patrols into the Bering Sea; and Russian  and Chinese military aircraft have been detected  tracked and intercepted by the North  American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) while flying in Alaska’s Air Defense  Identification Zone. This demonstrates the continued deepening of Chinese-Russian  military cooperation  particularly in the North Pacific approaches to the Arctic.  3\\t\\t“Below-threshold\\tconflict ”\\talso\\tknown\\tas\\t“grey\\tzone\\tconflict ”\\trefers\\tto\\tcompetitive\\tinteraction\\tbetween\\tstates\\tthat\\tfalls\\t  \\t short\\tof\\ttraditional\\tarmed\\tconflict\\tbut\\tgoes\\tbeyond\\tnormal\\tpeaceful\\trelations.\\tSuch\\tconflict\\tinvolves\\tactions\\tthat\\tare\\t  \\t coercive\\tand\\taggressive\\tbut\\tdeliberately\\tdesigned\\tto\\tremain\\tbelow\\tthe\\tthreshold\\tof\\tarmed\\tconflict.\\tThese\\tactions\\t  \\t could\\tinclude:\\tinformation\\twarfare\\tand\\tpropaganda;\\tcyber\\tattacks\\tand\\tespionage;\\teconomic\\tcoercion;\\tpolitical\\t  \\t interference\\tand\\telection\\tmeddling;\\tthe\\tuse\\tof\\tproxy\\tforces\\tor\\tparamilitary\\tgroups;\\tor\\t“lawfare”\\tand\\t  \\t exploiting\\tlegal\\tambiguities.  7  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Evolving    security    threats across    the Arctic  8  The Arctic is a strategically important region for the defence of North America and the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO’s) northern and western flanks. However    the defence architecture and threat picture differ across the circumpolar north.   The safety  security and defence of the Canadian Arctic comprise a fundamental  priority for the Government of Canada and are critical to the collective defence of North  America. The Arctic regions of North America are protected by the armed forces of  Canada and the United States  individually and bilaterally  and through NORAD    which is binational.  While the risk of military attack in the North American Arctic remains low  the region  represents a geographic vector for traditional and emerging weapons systems  that threaten broader North American and transatlantic security. Canada is seeing  a number of potential threats  including increased Russian activity in Canadian air  approaches  China’s regular deployment of dual-use—having both research and  military application—research vessels and surveillance platforms to collect data  and a  general increase in Arctic maritime activity. Adversaries and competitors also employ  disinformation and influence campaigns  malicious cyber operations and espionage  and foreign interference activities to target Canadians  including northerners.  Close partnership with the United States is essential to the maintenance of a secure   strong and well-defended North American homeland  on which the 2 countries’ mutual  prosperity depends. It is critical in deterring and defending against increasingly sophis- ticated threats to North America  including in the Arctic and its approaches in the North  Atlantic and North Pacific. We expect Canada–United States defence cooperation in  the Arctic to continue to grow  as it is fundamental to both countries’ national   security interests.  Strong and resilient Arctic and northern communities increase Canada’s defence  against threats. With increased tension and with competitors looking to exploit  vulnerabilities in the Canadian North  Canada must take action to build trust in public  institutions and deepen ties with like-minded states. Canada’s diplomacy and defence  and security policies must work hand in hand to keep these emerging threats in check.  The security of the European High North is also of critical importance to Canada’s  security and economic well-being.  The European High North is a contested region militarily  including threats to critical  infrastructure  maritime security  and safety  as well as access concerns. Russia has  established a strong military presence in the Arctic  including with air and naval   platforms equipped with missile systems capable of striking Europe and North   America and of disrupting Canada’s ability to project forces in support of allies and  partners. Russia’s below-threshold actions  military activities and continued weapons  testing in the European High North and the Arctic are deeply troubling.  NATO has strengthened its deterrence and defence posture  including in the European  High North  in response to the increased threat posed by Russia. The accessions of  Finland and Sweden to NATO  in 2023 and 2024 respectively  reinforced the Alliance by  bringing  among other things  their significant cold-weather experience and capabilities  to NATO  thereby bolstering its strategic posture in the European High North. Canada  was the first country to ratify each of their accessions. Canada will continue to share  information on threats in the Arctic with allies and to support NATO operations and  presence in the European High North.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Despite the changing threat picture  it is not in Canada’s strategic interest that the Arctic  becomes a theatre of military conflict. Canada will continue working with territorial   and provincial governments  Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples and allies and   partners throughout the Arctic region to enhance domain awareness  improve   information sharing and strengthen interoperability and research security.  Canada must also take action to mitigate the impact that current and emerging  defence and security threats to the Arctic have on the people who live in the region  and who now find themselves at the frontlines of geopolitical competition.

Adapting    to new    dynamics    for Arctic   governance  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has had cascading impacts on the governance of the  Arctic. While Arctic states continue to fulfill the important responsibility of governing  the Arctic region at a time of unprecedented change  like-minded countries are taking  coordinated action to ensure it is not business as usual with Russia.  The Arctic Council is the pre-eminent forum for international Arctic cooperation   and governance. It brings together the 8 Arctic states  the 6 Permanent Participant   organizations representing Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic  and observers to address   sustainable development and the environmental protection of the Arctic. The role  of Arctic Indigenous Peoples  from the foundation of the Arctic Council in 1996 to  the present  is one of the council’s greatest strengths and is unique in multilateral  governance. The council sets the bar for meaningful Indigenous engagement  which  continues to grow to this day. Arctic governance must be done with those who have  lived in the Arctic for thousands of years  recognizing the strength of shared knowledge  and decision making.   Meetings with all members of the council at the ministerial and Senior Arctic Official   levels remain on hold. Arctic states and Permanent Participants are working at the  expert and scientific level to advance important projects on climate change and  biodiversity  emergency prevention and preparedness and sustainable development.  These projects  along with the other work of the Arctic Council  are helping to drive  meaningful change for people who live across the Arctic. This unique work  done in  collaboration between the Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic and the Arctic states    is what makes the Arctic Council so valuable.  To ensure the maintenance of robust governance in the Arctic—governance that is  capable of tackling the increasing challenges and opportunities the region is facing— cooperation must continue at the Arctic Council. Canada must also identify new forums  and leverage existing ones in new ways to advance discussions on Arctic issues. Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples must be active partners in the conduct of   international relations in the Arctic.   Arctic states also meet in other regional and international forums that contribute to  upholding the rules-based international order  including the Arctic Coast Guard Forum  and the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement. The latter came into force in 2021   establishing a precautionary 16-year ban on commercial fishing on the high seas of   the Arctic Ocean.  Arctic states also play a leading role in advancing Arctic interests in broader global  efforts through the UN system  such as the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s)  ban on heavy fuel oil in the Arctic.  An extensive international legal framework applies to the Arctic Ocean. The law of  the sea  including as set out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)   determines states’ jurisdictions and their rights and obligations in various maritime  zones. These rules apply to the delineation of the outer limits of continental shelves   navigation  the management of natural resources  the protection of the marine environ- ment and other uses of the sea. Consistent with the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration4  Canada  remains committed to the orderly settlement of Arctic disputes in accordance with  international law and expects the same of other signatories  including Russia.  4\\t\\tThe\\tIlulissat\\tDeclaration\\twas\\tsigned\\tby\\tthe\\t5\\tArctic\\tOcean\\tcoastal\\tstates\\t(Canada \\tthe\\tUnited\\tStates \\tthe\\tKingdom\\tof\\t  \\t Denmark \\tNorway\\tand\\tRussia)\\tat\\tIlulissat \\tGreenland \\tin\\tMay\\t2008.\\tIn\\tthe\\tdeclaration \\tthe\\t5\\tstates\\tpledged\\tto\\tenhance\\t  \\t their\\tscientific\\tand\\tenvironmental\\tcooperation\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tOcean.\\tThey\\talso\\tcommitted\\tto\\tthe\\torderly\\tsettlement\\tof\\t  \\t overlaps\\tin\\ttheir\\trespective\\textended\\tcontinental\\tshelves \\tin\\taccordance\\twith\\tinternational\\tlaw.  11  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Canada has a clear interest in maintaining the structures of governance in   the Arctic that ensure Canada’s central role in guiding the region’s future.   Canada especially values the Arctic Council because it provides a platform   for Indigenous Peoples to help shape circumpolar affairs. Canada will not   allow Russia to undermine  through its actions  the pillars of international   cooperation in the Arctic.

Climate     change: the    overarching    threat  Climate change is both the most pressing and the most proximate threat to Canada’s  security in the Arctic and the people who live there. Its causes and effects are not  bound by countries’ official borders.  Climate change is progressing at an alarming pace  with the Arctic warming 4 times  faster than the global average  causing significant impacts on natural and human   environments. These impacts serve as threat multipliers because changing environ- mental conditions create additional opportunities for foreign adversaries and   competitors to covertly or overtly operate in the Canadian Arctic.  The total surface area of Arctic Ocean ice is shrinking  with varied implications for  maritime shipping  trade and resource extraction across the Arctic. Maritime traffic in  the Arctic will continue to increase  which will drive further foreign interest in the region.  This includes maritime traffic in Canada’s Arctic Archipelago  despite the risks and  hazards associated with the unpredictable ice conditions.  With retreating sea ice and new technologies improving navigation and accessibility   foreign activity in the Arctic will continue to increase  bringing with it related safety   security and environmental challenges. With other Arctic states  Canada must be  prepared to respond.  Climate change is also driving an increase in climate-related emergencies and   disrupting ecosystems that Arctic communities rely on for their livelihoods  with   significant implications for the security of northerners  including Indigenous Peoples   who are disproportionately affected by these changes.  Northerners  including Indigenous Peoples  have shared concerns about climate  change and their ongoing efforts to improve their resiliency in the face of increased  pressures on communities and livelihoods  food security and the destabilization of  critical and civilian infrastructure. The disappearance of year-round ice cover and  changes in the timing and durability of the floe edge; increasing subsidence due to  permafrost thaw; and a greater frequency and severity of wildfires are examples of the  impacts of climate change on Arctic communities  all of which have both material and  psychological impacts.  For instance  communities in the North are often impacted by major wildfires. In 2023   more than half of the population of the Northwest Territories had to be evacuated.   There is an ongoing need to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change in the  Arctic to reduce vulnerabilities. Canada must support Arctic and northern Indigenous  Peoples and other northerners in adapting to the environment as it is and will be—not  as one wishes it would be.   In parallel  climate change is driving interest in the Arctic as a sustainable and reliable  source of critical minerals  such as lithium  graphite  nickel  cobalt  copper and rare  earth elements integral to the transition to a low-carbon economy. For Canada and  its allies  the Arctic’s resource potential provides an opportunity to diversify critical  mineral production in partnership with territorial and provincial governments  Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples and local communities. This must be done carefully   respecting the livelihoods of local communities.   Climate change is a global problem; it requires global solutions and multilateral collaboration.  13  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 5.  Increasing     challenges to    Arctic states’    primacy  Canada’s approach to the Arctic is guided by the fundamental principle that the Arctic  should be governed by the Arctic states in collaboration with Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples. As in other regions  strategic competition in the Arctic is growing   with non-Arctic states and actors increasingly expressing foreign policy or security  aspirations  thereby pushing for greater roles in Arctic affairs.  Since 2019  there has been a growing narrative among some non-Arctic states that  they should have a greater say in Arctic governance. China  in particular  has expressed  an ambition to become a “polar great power ” by 2030.  Among China’s priorities in the Arctic are developing commercial shipping opportuni- ties  including a “Polar Silk Road ” as well as natural resource exploitation  including of  critical minerals  oil and gas and fish. China is also active in Arctic research  much   of which can be considered dual use.  China seeks to shape the international order into a more permissive environment for  interests and values that increasingly deviate from Canada’s commitment to a rules- based international system. China can be expected to use all the tools at its disposal   to advance its geopolitical interests  including in the Arctic. Canada will challenge China  when it ought to and cooperate when its interests align with China’s.  China  like all states  has rights and responsibilities related to its use of the world’s  oceans that apply equally in the Arctic. For example  in accordance with UNCLOS   China can only conduct marine scientific research in the exclusive economic zone  of another state with the consent of that state. Canada will carefully review any such  requests related to its own exclusive economic zone and provide or withhold consent  consistent with the provisions of the convention.  14  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   Photo Credit: © Global Affairs  Canada  Consistent with its Indo-Pacific Strategy and in collaboration with partners  Canada will  always act on matters of Arctic governance to protect national and northern interests   including when dealing with China. Canada will cooperate with China to address   pressing global issues—such as climate change—that have impacts on the Arctic.  In the Canadian Arctic  Canada will always work to protect Canada’s economic security   safeguard Canadian values and protect Canadians from malign influence.  Canada will continue to work closely with the United States to counter all forms   of malign influence and activity in the North American Arctic.   In the wider region  Canada will always uphold the founding principles that under- pinned the Ottawa Declaration in 1996 on the establishment of the Arctic Council.  These include Canada’s commitment to the well-being of the inhabitants of the Arctic;  its commitment to sustainable development in the Arctic region  including economic  and social development  improved health conditions and cultural well-being; its   commitment to the protection of the Arctic environment; and its commitment to  ensure full consultation with  and the involvement of  Indigenous Peoples and their   communities and other inhabitants of the Arctic on Arctic Council activities.  At all times  Canada’s engagement in the Arctic will be focused first and foremost on  promoting and defending Canadian national interests. Canada will adopt a pragmatic  approach when circumstances require it.  15  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ARCTIC FOREIGN  POLICY PILLARS  The Arctic Foreign Policy provides Global Affairs Canada  with additional diplomatic tools to support a stable   prosperous and secure Arctic and to fully implement   the objectives laid out in the International chapter of   the ANPF given the changing geopolitical context.  We will do this by continuing to assert Canada’s   sovereignty; advancing Canada’s national interests  through pragmatic diplomacy; leading on Arctic   governance and multilateral challenges; and adopting   a more inclusive approach to Arctic diplomacy.

Leveraging diplomacy to support national defence and security  The Government of Canada will continue to take a   comprehensive approach to Arctic security by prioritizing  the security  interests and priorities of the Arctic region  and northerners  as well as Canadians more broadly.  Canada’s foreign and defence policies are closely  intertwined and complementary. Effective diplomacy  is critical for shaping the international environment to  defend and advance Canadian national interests; it is   a first line of defence for Canada’s national security.   Canada’s fundamental defence and security goal is   to prevent and defuse potential crises before they can  develop into conflict.  Canada’s national security is also supported by human  security. Strong and resilient local communities are vital  to national defence.  Canada engages in the Arctic from a position of strength  thanks to the Canadian Armed Forces’ (CAF’s) presence  and capabilities  exercises and operations  including  those of the Canadian Rangers. Canadian Rangers are  active  well-respected members of their communities   and they play a critical role in demonstrating Canadian  sovereignty over the lands  waters and ice of Canada’s  North and Arctic.  Building on the NORAD modernization investments  announced in 2022  Canada’s defence policy update  Our North  Strong and Free identified the Government of  Canada’s most pressing priority as the continued asser- tion of Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and northern  regions. Canada is making investments to ensure that  the CAF has the capabilities required to operate in an  evolving geopolitical context. By 2030  Canada will have  almost tripled its defence spending from 2015.  Strengthened military capabilities will bolster the CAF’s  ability to conduct and sustain operations in the Arctic  and create opportunities for strengthened collaboration  with allies and partners. Canada regularly invites select  allies and partners to take part in Operation NANOOK   the CAF’s signature northern operation series. Canada  also works with allies and partners on multinational  research and development activities relevant to the  conduct of defence and security operations in   the polar regions.   In addition to NORAD modernization and the defence  policy update  Canada is pursuing historic investments  to increase its military capability in the maritime domain  in the Arctic. Ensuring that Canada’s internal waters in  the Arctic are well defended is a critical component of  maintaining a secure North American homeland. Canada  will maintain strong defence capabilities in its internal  Arctic waters  including in the Northwest Passage.   17  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Here is a summary of key defence   and security investments:    Several military capabilities will play a key role in   exercising Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and  northern waters  including Canada’s 6 new Arctic  Offshore Patrol Ships; up to 15 new River Class  Destroyers; 11 new MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones;   up to 16 new P-8A Poseidon multi-mission aircraft  specialized in anti-submarine and anti-surface  warfare; and 88 new F-35A fighter aircraft.     Canada’s $38.6 billion plan to modernize NORAD will  significantly enhance domain awareness in the Arctic  and the North through the establishment of a   new northern approaches surveillance system to   complement the North Warning System and further   investment in space-based surveillance. It also  includes further investment in space-based polar  communications; additional air-to-air refuelling aircraft  to support and extend the reach of CAF operations— and NORAD operations—in Canada; additional and  longer-range air-to-air missiles for Canada’s fighter  fleet; significant infrastructure upgrades at airfields  used to support NORAD forward operations; and   more than $4 billion in new funding for science   and technology.    The defence policy update announced an additional  $8.1 billion in spending over the next 5 years and   $73 billion over the next 20 years to support   Canada’s national defence and security in the Arctic.  This includes a new fleet of airborne early warning  and control aircraft; specialized maritime sensors   including some that can be deployed by Harry  DeWolf-class Arctic Offshore Patrol vessels; a new  fleet of tactical helicopters; and a new satellite  ground station in the Arctic to enhance the use of  Canadian  U.S. and other Allied space capabilities.     The defence policy update will also establish a new  network of Northern Operational Support Hubs to  further enhance the CAF’s presence  responsiveness  and partnerships across the Arctic and the North  and invest in multi-use infrastructure that also meets  the needs of the territories  Indigenous Peoples and  northern communities.    In July 2024  Canada announced it would initiate new  spending programs to put the country on track to  reach NATO’s target of 2% of GDP spending by 2032.  This will include the purchase of up to 12 convention- ally powered  under-ice-capable submarines by the  Royal Canadian Navy.    In 2024  the Government of Canada initiated the   procurement of 8 new icebreakers made in Canada  to support Canadian Coast Guard operations in the  Arctic  including 2 polar icebreakers that will enable  year-round icebreaker presence in the Arctic. The  icebreakers will contribute to the protection of the  marine environment  the resupplying of communities  and the collection of data that enhances Canada’s  maritime domain awareness in support of maritime  safety and security  climate resilience and   scientific research.    In July 2024  Canada  the United States and Finland   announced an enhanced trilateral partnership called  the ICE Pact. It is a collaborative effort to build best- in-class Arctic and polar icebreakers and other Arctic  and polar capabilities in each of the countries by  sharing expertise  information and capabilities. This  partnership also bolsters the ability of like-minded  nations to uphold international rules  norms and  standards to ensure safety and to sustain peace and  stability in the Arctic.  The diplomatic initiatives in the Arctic Foreign Policy will  complement all of these investments by better aligning  Canada’s strategic approaches and by strengthening  its relationships with its Arctic allies  with territorial and  provincial governments and with Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners.  18  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy i.  Bridging the intelligence gap  To address the complex range of threats faced in the  Arctic  Canada must conceptualize security not only in  military terms. Security in the Arctic includes community  security  research security  economic security  security  against disinformation and any other form of interference  and physical and digital infrastructure security.  We will work with Public Safety Canada to support efforts  to strengthen Canadian national resilience to counter  malign influence and activities of foreign powers. Canada  will strengthen the defence of its critical infrastructure  across the country  including in the Arctic  to protect  northern communities against foreign interference. This  can be achieved through the Investment Canada Act;  by strengthening Canadian cyber security systems; and  through new legislation to address foreign interference.  We will provide relevant territorial   provincial and Indigenous  governments with regular briefings  and information on emerging and  developing international security  trends  including threats affecting the  Arctic  to ensure that they are equipped  to support communities in Canada’s  Arctic and North and to make informed  decisions about the security of their  communities.  This will be achieved in collaboration  with the Canadian Security Intelligence  Service  the Communications Security  Establishment  the Department of  National Defence and Public   Safety Canada.

Global Affairs Canada will support the  work of Innovation  Science and Economic  Development Canada  Crown-Indigenous  Relations and Northern Affairs and its  portfolio agencies  the Department of  National Defence  Natural Resources  Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada   among others  to support the scientific  research permitting process in the Arctic   particularly for international applicants  undertaking research that can be  considered dual use.  To help ensure emerging challenges  concerning research security and science  collaboration in the North are addressed    we will help by increasing our capacity  to learn about concerns from those on  the ground  holding annual round-table  meetings on science and research relating  to Canada’s Arctic foreign policy priorities.  We will work closely with other federal  government departments and agencies   to organize the round-table meetings.  The Arctic ambassador (see Pillar 4 -  Adopting a more inclusive approach to  Arctic diplomacy) will work with Indigenous  Peoples and partners from territorial and  provincial governments  as well as across  the Government of Canada  to contribute  to the efforts to address climate change   biodiversity and other areas where  Indigenous Knowledge  science and  technologies could contribute solutions   to the challenges in the Arctic.  The Arctic ambassador will also work with  Canada’s Chief Science Advisor on issues  related to science and research.  20  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  ii.  Strengthening research security  International scientific collaboration plays an important  role in addressing gaps in knowledge of the Arctic  region  including in relation to climate change. The last  20 years have seen a marked increase in international  research activity across the Canadian and   circumpolar Arctic.   While Canada continues to welcome scientific   collaboration in the Arctic  Canada’s oversight  regu- latory  safety and security bodies must be equipped  to address potential threats and harms at all levels. In  particular  Canada must guard against foreign research  in the Canadian Arctic and North that is dual use—having  both research and military application.   This requires balancing between the important priority  of advancing recognized areas of needed international  scientific collaboration  such as climate change research   with necessary due diligence to protect Canada’s most  sensitive research.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy iii. Partnering with the Canadian Coast Guard      to support defence and security  The Canadian Coast Guard  alongside other partner  departments and agencies  is responsible for maritime  domain awareness and plays a critical role in supporting  the defence and security of the North.  Building on the Canadian Coast Guard Arctic Strategy   released in 2024  the Canadian Coast Guard will continue  to contribute to Canada’s national security  including  through its assistance to Arctic scientific   research expeditions.  The Canadian Coast Guard currently operates up to   6 icebreakers in the Arctic from June to November each  year  which helps advance maritime safety and security.  In the coming years  the Canadian Coast Guard will  acquire 8 new icebreakers  including 2 polar icebreakers  that will provide capacity for year-round presence   in the Arctic.  The Canadian Coast Guard also helps to deepen  Canadian defence cooperation with Arctic allies through  Operation Pacer Goose. The annual operation resupplies  the United States’ Pituffik Space Base (formerly known  as Thule Air Base) in Greenland  ensuring that essential  supplies are safely delivered in challenging   Arctic conditions.  To strengthen the interconnections  between the Arctic Foreign Policy  and the Canadian Coast Guard Arctic  Strategy  we will collaborate more  closely with the Canadian Coast  Guard to leverage its maritime  domain expertise and support its  work with international partners.  Through its operations and activities   the Canadian Coast Guard helps  contribute to stronger relationships with  Canada’s Arctic allies. Through deeper  collaboration  the Canadian Coast  Guard will also be able to expand its  partnerships with regional coast guards  from like-minded states.   21  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy iv. Strengthening regional defence      and security architectures  To respond to the evolving threat landscape in the Arctic   Canada will strengthen coordination and dialogue with  Arctic allies on security issues.  Alongside the Department of National Defence  we  will increase our information sharing with NATO on  circumpolar threats. We will improve interoperability and  increase the collective understanding of the evolving  security situation in the Arctic and enhance the Alliance’s  cold-weather capabilities. Canada will continue to be  an active participant in NATO exercises and operations   including in the European High North.  To ensure seamless situational awareness and informa- tion sharing on northern threats that do not recognize  borders or military command areas of responsibility   Canada supports greater coordination and collaboration  between the military forces of like-minded Arctic states   including in the context of NATO and NORAD activities.  Canada will explore and foster new partnerships to  strengthen the strategic resilience of the North American  Arctic  particularly with Alaska  the Yukon  the Northwest  Territories  Nunavut and Greenland.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  To complement existing defence forums  Canada is exploring opportunities to deepen  security dialogue among all like-minded states in the Arctic  including through regular  security discussions.    Canada will initiate an Arctic security dialogue with the ministers of foreign affairs of  like-minded states in the Arctic. Discussions will focus on sharing information on  and  on analyses of  issues relating to international Arctic relations and security; as well  as discussing national approaches to cross-cutting security challenges; advancing  opportunities for collaboration; and increasing collective resilience.  22  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Upholding the rules-based international order  The waters of Canada’s Arctic Archipelago  including   the various channels comprising the Northwest Passage   are internal waters of Canada by virtue of historic title  and in accordance with international law. Canada’s Arctic  sovereignty encompasses land  sea and ice. It extends  without interruption to the seaward-facing coasts of the  Arctic islands and beyond. These islands are joined  not  divided  by the waters between them and are bridged for  a large part of the year by ice.  Indigenous Peoples in Canada have used and occupied  the ice and waters as they have used and occupied  the lands for thousands of years. Every day  through a  wide range of activities  Arctic and northern Indigenous  Peoples and governments  as well as territorial and  provincial governments and other northerners  share  stewardship over the Arctic lands and waters of Canada.  It is through the reciprocal recognition of each other’s  mutual interests in these lands and waters that Canada  and Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples share in the  stewardship of them—further codified in modern treaties  and self-government agreements. Sovereignty and   sovereign rights in the Arctic are inextricably linked   to issues of Indigenous self-government. Canada   possesses environmental  economic  cultural and   historical interests unique to the region  the reality  and importance of which are clearly evidenced by  long-standing usage.  Canada will work with Arctic and  northern Indigenous partners to assert  shared interests and priorities in the  region  such as through partnerships  with the Inuit Marine Monitoring  Program and the Indigenous  Guardians program.5 These initiatives  provide Indigenous Peoples with  greater opportunities to exercise  responsibility for the stewardship of  their traditional lands  waters and ice.  Canada intends to continue to act as a responsible  sovereign of its Arctic territories and waters  relying on  the rules-based international order and supported by  historical and scientific evidence. Canada’s commitment  to ensuring that maritime claims are addressed in a  manner that is consistent with international law is one   of its key enduring priorities in the Arctic.

Managing Arctic boundaries through    a rules-based approach  At a time when the rules-based international order   is under unprecedented threat  it is critical that states  resolve their disputes responsibly  through dialogue  and negotiation. Canada has made resolving boundary  disputes in accordance with international law one of the  foundational principles of its foreign policy in the Arctic.  Enhanced international cooperation on maritime  boundaries also helps secure states’ respective national  interests over their resources  including energy  minerals   fish and wildlife.  Canada will advance efforts to resolve  Arctic boundary disputes peacefully  and in accordance with international  law  including UNCLOS  and in  consultation with Indigenous partners   particularly where these international  boundaries may affect treaty rights.  Canada–Kingdom of Denmark  boundary agreement  Canada  the Kingdom of Denmark  and  Greenland have resolved the maritime  boundary and long-time dispute over  Tartupaluk. In June 2022  following  5 years of intensive negotiations   the Canadian  Nunavut  Danish and  Greenlandic governments agreed  on a modernized single maritime  boundary  from the Lincoln Sea in  the north to the Labrador Sea in  the south—a distance of over 3 000  kilometres—which established the  longest bilateral maritime boundary  in the world. The agreement also  resolved the overlap in our respective  continental shelves in the Labrador Sea.  With the Kingdom of Denmark   Canada agreed to divide the island  of Tartupaluk roughly in half; Canada  is now advancing discussions on an  agreed border regime for Tartupaluk   which requires engagement with the  Government of Nunavut and local  Inuit communities. This is the last step  before the agreement can come into  force  which Canada is committed to  completing in the near future.  24  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Extended continental shelf  Canada–United States   Beaufort Sea boundary  In September 2024  Canada launched  negotiations with the United States to  resolve the 2 countries’ long-standing  maritime boundary dispute in the  Beaufort Sea. The area in question  is north of the Yukon and Alaska and  measures approximately 270 000  square kilometres. Both countries claim  jurisdiction over the disputed region  by way of differing legal interpretations  of the 1825 treaty between Russia and  Great Britain.  Reflecting the Government of Canada’s  commitment to partnership and  reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples   the boundary negotiations will involve  impacted Inuit Treaty Organizations and  close consultations with territorial and  Indigenous governments.   In December 2022  Canada filed  an addendum to its Arctic Ocean  extended continental shelf  submission with the Commission on  the Limits of the Continental Shelf  in response to Russia’s addendum   which was filed in March 2021. Russia’s  addendum greatly expanded the size  of the continental shelf included in its  submission and tripled the area that  overlaps with Canada’s own continental  shelf. Canada’s 2022 addendum  rebalanced the overlap area.  In December 2023  the United  States published the outer limits  of its extended continental shelf  in the western Arctic Ocean. This  announcement offers an opportunity  for Canada to renew negotiations  with the United States regarding the  overlap of the countries’ respective  continental shelves. These discussions  are expected to begin in late 2024.  Canada  like all Arctic Ocean coastal  states  remains committed to settling  continental shelf overlap areas  peacefully and in accordance   with international law.  25  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Advancing Canada’s interests   through pragmatic diplomacy  A fundamental principle of Canadian foreign policy is that the Arctic   should be governed by the Arctic states. This has long been a shared   principle of the Arctic states and has produced a long period    of peaceful cooperation and development in the region.   1. Strengthening Canada’s partnerships with Arctic allies  i.  The United States   The United States is Canada’s closest partner and ally   in the Arctic  and this collaboration extends across many  shared interests. Collaboration is advanced by Canada’s  extensive diplomatic network of 13 missions across the  United States and through various bilateral mechanisms.  With the United States  Canada shares a unique   relationship shaped by geography  history  shared values   common interests and strong people-to-people connec- tions. This is especially the case in the Arctic  particularly  among Indigenous Peoples  whose history  culture and  connections transcend national borders.   The Canada–United States defence partnership is  essential to maintaining a secure North American   homeland. Canada welcomes the continued partici- pation of the United States’ military and coast guard in  Canada-led exercises and operations in Canada’s   Arctic and North.  Going forward  Canada will continue to advance bilateral cooperation with the United  States in the North at all levels of government in existing areas of importance and explore  new avenues of cooperation in critical areas of national interest  including: security and  safety; the defence of North America; science and research technology; energy security;  supply chains; climate change; critical minerals; sustainable development; Indigenous  cross-border mobility; economic development; marine and terrestrial conservation; and the  protection of transboundary species  including salmon and the Porcupine caribou herd.  26  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii.   The Nordic states  Canada maintains close relations with its Nordic Arctic  neighbours; specifically  the Kingdom of Denmark  (consisting of Denmark  Greenland and the Faroe  Islands)  Finland  Iceland  Norway and Sweden. These  close relationships are underpinned by shared values   a common outlook on the world and a shared commit- ment to ensuring a peaceful and stable Arctic through  the enduring success of NATO. They continue to grow  stronger  with a particularly marked increase in dialogue  and cooperation since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now  more than ever  it is critical for Canada to have strong  partnerships with the Nordic states  as Canada and they  are all now members of NATO and Russia’s actions have  complicated cooperation in multilateral spaces of Arctic  governance. Examples of Canada’s close relationships  with its Nordic Arctic neighbours include the following:    In 2022  Canada was the first country to ratify    the accessions of Finland and Sweden to NATO.    In June 2023  Canada’s prime minister was the  invited guest at the Nordic prime ministers’   annual meeting  in Iceland.    In June 2024  the Government of Canada committed  up to $20 million in funding for an international  research initiative on the sustainable development  of the Arctic in collaboration with NordForsk  an   organization under the Nordic Council of Ministers.  It will support collaborative and multi-disciplinary  scientific efforts and contributions from across the  Arctic region and include Indigenous perspectives.    In September 2024  Canada’s minister of foreign affairs  and the premier of Nunavut co-hosted representa- tives from the Kingdom of Denmark  Finland  Iceland   Norway and Sweden for the first Canada-Nordic  Strategic Dialogue  in Iqaluit  Nunavut.    Canada is committed to deepening its partnership  with the Nordic countries as friends and allies with  common values and shared stewardship over the Arctic.  Strengthening Canada’s cooperation will also help it  respond to new threats and below-threshold activities by  its adversaries in both the North American Arctic and the  European High North.   Working in collaboration with other  federal departments  we will increase  our support for bilateral and regional  cooperation with the Kingdom of  Denmark  Finland  Iceland  Norway  and Sweden in Arctic science and  technology  climate change  culture   Indigenous-to-Indigenous ties  natural  resources  sustainable development  through trade and infrastructure and  defence and security.  We will also create a new position  in one of Canada’s Nordic missions  with responsibility for increasing  coordination and information sharing   including on security issues    with Nordic partners.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  27  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy To do this  we will open new consulates in Anchorage   Alaska  and Nuuk  Greenland.  Alaska is a key partner on a range of issues  including  border security and crossings  security and defence in  the Arctic  climate resilience and conservation  energy  security  critical minerals and Indigenous affairs.   Members of the CAF are stationed in Alaska to support  the NORAD mission and work alongside their U.S. military  counterparts in the defence of North America.  In addition  the Yukon also has mature and close-knit  bilateral relations with Alaska from both a political and  trade perspective.   iii. The North American Arctic: Alaska and Greenland  The North American Arctic encompasses the vast   northern territories of 3 countries: Alaska (the United  States) in the west; northern Canada in the centre;   and Greenland (the Kingdom of Denmark) in the east.   The relationships in this region are unique due to   geographical proximity and the ancestral relations   that exist between Indigenous Peoples  which give rise   to a number of shared interests  including on security   defence  climate change  sustainable development   critical minerals  trade  culture and Indigenous mobility.  The ANPF emphasizes increasing cooperation among  federal  territorial  provincial and Indigenous govern- ments and other organizations in and across the   Canadian Arctic and with Canada’s North American   Arctic partners.  The Arctic Foreign Policy complements this by  re-emphasizing the importance of deepening Canada’s  diplomatic engagement with its neighbours  the United  States  including Alaska  and the Kingdom of Denmark   including Greenland. This will make the Canadian and  North American Arctic more secure and create new  opportunities for economic cooperation  scientific   collaboration and cultural exchange.   The consulate in Anchorage will help promote trade and  economic ties between Canada’s territories and provinces and  Alaska; improve security and defence partnerships; strengthen  collaboration on environmental and wildlife issues; engage with  Alaskan communities  including Indigenous communities; and  support cross-border people-to-people ties.   28  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Many ties  both formal and informal  have been forged  over the years at all levels of government and between  Inuit organizations in Canada and Greenland. Several  bilateral initiatives have been advanced in recent years   including the Letter of Intent for Cooperation on the  Pikialasorsuaq (2023) and the Memorandum of Under- standing between the Government of Greenland and the  Government of Nunavut (2022). However  cooperation to  date has largely occurred organically  without an   overarching foreign policy framework.  In recognition of the growing importance of Greenland   as a key Arctic partner  a more coordinated approach  with Greenland  including with the government of   Nunavut  is a priority in ensuring that Canadian   interests are being advanced effectively.  The consulate in Nuuk will be a  valuable resource for coordinating  and advancing Canadian interests in  Greenland  enhancing bilateral and  commercial relations  facilitating  research collaboration and supporting  increased engagement and  collaboration across many   policy spaces.  We welcome Greenland’s  commitment to open a  representational office in Canada.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  29  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Holding    Russia    accountable  Russia represents a generational geopolitical challenge.  Although Russia accounts for 50% of the Arctic   geographically  bilateral cooperation between Canada  and Russia  including in the Arctic  will remain   exceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future.  Canada will continue to hold Russia accountable in regional  and multilateral forums for its actions and counter disinformation  promoted by the Russian regime  including through Canada’s  leadership of the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism. This includes  countering disinformation targeting communities   in the Canadian Arctic.   Alongside allies and partners  Canada will continue confronting  Russian aggression  including through Canada’s enduring   support for Ukraine  and by continuing to meet NATO   defence commitments.  Together with the United States  Canada will defend NATO’s  western flank  and with Arctic allies  Canada will defend NATO’s  northern regions and approaches.  Canada acknowledges that the actions of the Putin  regime do not always reflect the values of the Russian  people. This policy clearly differentiates between   government actions and those of the broader Russian  population  including its Indigenous Peoples  who them- selves have been marginalized by the Russian regime.  Across all multilateral bodies  Canada will maintain its  policy of limited engagement with Russian officials.  It is for Russia to create the conditions that will enable  a return to political engagement and cooperation by  ending its war in Ukraine and acting in accordance   with international law.  30  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   3.  Pragmatic    diplomacy    with non-    Arctic states    and actors  While Canada will continue to prioritize cooperation   with Arctic states  especially when it comes to setting  the rules that govern the region  cooperation with a  wider set of actors is beneficial and necessary to address  challenges to the Arctic emanating from global issues   such as climate change.  Given the prospect of growing competition in the Arctic   Canada will be strategic in prioritizing pragmatic   cooperation with non-Arctic states and actors that   align with Canadian values  interests and objectives.  Canada will be guided by the following principles:   › Respect for Arctic states’ sovereignty  sovereign rights and    jurisdiction in the Arctic.   › Support for the rules-based international order in the Arctic    and a demonstrated commitment to regional peace and stability.   › Respect for Indigenous self-determination  Indigenous rights and the values    interests  cultures and traditions of Arctic Indigenous Peoples  including the   participation of Indigenous Peoples in Arctic decision making  and other   Arctic inhabitants.   › Respect for the extensive legal framework that applies to the Arctic Ocean     including UNCLOS.   › Recognition of interests and expertise that are relevant to  and aligned with     Canada’s Arctic and northern priorities  as well as its national defence   and security interests.   › Maintaining a commitment to uphold and advance democratic values    human rights and gender equality according to international standards    regulations and principles.   › Openness with regard to scientific data sharing and collaboration   with Canadian researchers and local communities  including their   representative governments.   › Commitment to sustainable development  conservation  environmental    protection and fighting climate change.   Engagement with non-Arctic states and actors will be  channeled through a variety of multilateral forums  such  as the Arctic Council  appropriate UN bodies  NATO and  the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable  as well as treaties  that apply to the Arctic  such as the Central Arctic Ocean  Fisheries Agreement  and bilateral and multilateral   platforms and projects that we will drive with other  federal departments and agencies.  Going forward  based on the above principles  Canada  will place particular emphasis on cooperation with  non-Arctic states and actors in 2 regions: the North  Atlantic and the North Pacific.  31  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy The North Atlantic  Canada will strengthen engagement  on Arctic matters with the European  Union  the United Kingdom and other  key North Atlantic states through  established mechanisms  such as the  Canada–European Union Strategic  Partnership Agreement. Science   technology and innovation will remain  the focus of Canada’s cooperation with  the European Union and key European  states through Canada’s engagement  on the European Union–United  States–Canada Arctic Working Group  of the All-Atlantic Ocean Research  and Innovation Alliance; the Canada- European Union Ocean Partnership  Forum; and the Horizon   Europe program.  Other priorities for Arctic cooperation include facilitating  the mobility of Inuit between Canada and Greenland;  facilitating the trade of  and access to  the seal products  of Inuit and other Indigenous Peoples  in the E.U. market;  the conservation of fish stocks through the Canada– European Union High-Level Dialogue on Fisheries;   environmental protection; climate mitigation and   adaptation; trade and sustainable economic   development; security cooperation through   high-level dialogues; and the Canada–European   Union Green Alliance.  The United Kingdom is another close partner in the  North Atlantic based on Canada’s deep partnership   with the country and their historic ties and shared values.  The 2 countries enjoy a close-knit defence partnership   and they cooperate on shared priorities in the Arctic   including on climate change and research through   the Canada–Inuit Nunangat–United Kingdom Arctic   Research Programme.    Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  32  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy The\\tNorth\\tPacific  Canada’s Indo-Pacific Strategy recognizes that several  Indo-Pacific states are looking to the Arctic as a region  of opportunity and as a means through which to engage  with Canada.  The strategy recognizes the North Pacific as part of  Canada’s neighbourhood. The North Pacific  through  the Bering Strait  is one of the key approaches to the  North American Arctic. Canada must not undervalue the  strategic importance of these approaches—Canada’s  adversaries do not underestimate them. In line with the  strategy  Canada will explore ways to deepen Arctic  cooperation with key North Pacific states on issues of  mutual interest while also responding to the emerging  challenges some may represent.  While Canada is pleased to engage with Indo-Pacific  states making positive contributions in the Arctic accord- ing to the principles for engagement with non-Arctic  states  Canada will closely scrutinize activities of states  whose ambitions or activities are potentially counter to  Canadian values  interests or objectives in the region.  In addition to Canada’s long-standing partnership with the  United States on Arctic issues  focus will be given to increasing  cooperation with other key partners in the region—Japan and the  Republic of Korea—given the mutual long-standing relationships  and shared values of the 3 nations.  Canada will work through established forums and mechanisms   such as the Arctic Council  the Canada-Japan Action Plan for  Contributing to a Free and Open Indo-Pacific Region and the  Canada-Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership  to identify  concrete opportunities to deepen cooperation between the   4 countries on shared priorities  such as maritime security   science and technology  trade and sustainable economic   development and fisheries.  33  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Leadership on Arctic governance  and multilateral challenges  Despite\\texceedingly\\tdifficult\\trelations\\twith\\tRussia \\tArctic\\tstates\\t  continue to preside over a well-governed region operating under   extensive national and international legal frameworks.

Reinforcing      the Arctic    Council  Canada is firmly committed to the enduring value of the  Arctic Council and is adhering to its established Rules  of Procedure. Canada remains focused on continuing  the council’s important work for the benefit of the Arctic  region and the people living there  including   Indigenous Peoples.    Since 2021  our Global Arctic Leadership Initiative has  funded the establishment of a permanent secretariat  of the Arctic Council’s Sustainable Development   Working Group in Canada and provided over $2 million  in funding for more than 25 Arctic Council initiatives  with national  civil society and Indigenous partners.   The Arctic Council exists thanks in part to Canadian and  Indigenous leadership. Canada will not allow Russia’s  actions to undermine the integrity or functionality of this  important body. The people of the Arctic  who benefit so  deeply from the important work of the council  should  not be made to suffer because of Russia’s choices.     We will increase our contributions to the Arctic Council to allow for more Canadian  engagement and leadership in council projects and greater institutional support for the  council  as well as provide funding for innovative Indigenous and youth ideas in the council.  This support is critically important as the council continues to increase its activities.  Canada will increase its leadership in the council in preparation for Canada’s third chairship  of the Arctic Council  from 2029 to 2031. Working with Canadian and Arctic Council  partners  Canada will meaningfully engage the Permanent Participants from Canada   territorial and provincial governments of Canada and other Indigenous partners on the  planning and development of Canada’s Arctic Council chairship program.   Those essential building blocks will also provide guidance on how Canada engages in  other international polar processes  such as the International Polar Year: 2032 to 2033  which  is an opportunity to showcase Canada’s leadership through scientific and technological  achievements  as well as by amplifying Indigenous Peoples’ voices and   their rich knowledge.  35  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Addressing regional     and global challenges  i.  Climate change and environmental protection  While the triple crisis of climate change  biodiversity   loss and pollution is a global problem that requires  urgent collective action  the impacts of this triple crisis  are disproportionately felt by northerners. Canada has  taken a dual-track approach to addressing these issues   with engagement at the multilateral level through the  UN system and at the regional level through   the Arctic Council.  In addition to robust domestic measures to address  climate change  Canada is also working with international  partners to boost global efforts to achieve the Paris  Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C to avoid   the most devastating impacts for the world    including the Arctic.  Cutting emissions of black carbon is the most powerful  action to take to slow the pace of near-term warming in  the Arctic. For this reason  Arctic states agreed to   collectively reduce emissions of black carbon by 25%   to 33% of 2013 levels by 2025. Canada is on track to do   its part in achieving this collective goal.  Canada is also doing its part to address biodiversity loss  and advance conservation domestically and globally.  Canada continues to work toward conserving 30%   of its lands and oceans by 2030. A large part of   Canada’s protected and conserved areas fall within   Canada’s Arctic and North  and many are being   co-managed with Indigenous Peoples.6   To increase cohesiveness  we will continue to leverage  our diplomatic resources in support of all government  efforts led by Environment and Climate Change  Canada in the UN system to ensure implementation  of the historic Paris Agreement  of the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change  and of the  Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework  under the Convention on Biological Diversity.

The ambassador will also continue to promote any other diplomatic  initiatives that address climate change. The Arctic ambassador will support this work.  Additionally  in the context of the Arctic Council’s initiatives on climate change  Canada will  continue its ongoing work at a regional level to develop scientific assessments on the  impacts of climate change and the state of biodiversity in the Arctic; to reduce short-lived  climate pollutants in the Arctic region; to encourage the use and development of renewable  energy in remote Arctic communities to exchange knowledge and implement solutions  on wildfires and climate change adaptation in an Arctic context; to develop a pan-Arctic  network of marine protected areas; and to implement the regional action plan on marine  litter in the Arctic.  Elsewhere  we will encourage all allies to join NATO’s Climate Change and Security  Centre of Excellence  which is based in Montréal. Working with the Department of  National Defence  we will also leverage the centre’s expertise to promote research and  knowledge sharing on climate security threats in the Arctic and elsewhere.

This  imposes a responsibility on Canada to ensure that the  area is well managed. Canada is collaborating closely  with fellow Arctic Ocean coastal states and other   interested parties to implement the Central Arctic Ocean  Fisheries Agreement  which established a precautionary  16-year ban on commercial fishing on the high seas of  the Arctic Ocean  as well as a program for joint scientific  research and monitoring that includes Indigenous  Knowledge as a vital component to ensure that the best  available knowledge is used in decision making. Canada  is also ensuring that Inuit in Canada continue to be part  of this process.  Canada is also prioritizing the protection of the marine  environment in the Arctic Ocean in cooperation with  its like-minded international and Indigenous partners.  Canada maintains an indefinite moratorium on offshore  oil and gas development in its Arctic waters. Canada  also supports  in the absence of both a comprehensive  understanding of seabed mining’s environmental  impacts and a robust regulatory regime  a moratorium  on commercial seabed mining in areas beyond national  jurisdiction  including in the central Arctic Ocean.  Canada is committed to reinforcing rules-based  approaches in the Arctic Ocean.  We will work with other departments and agencies   to continue to develop and implement international  measures to promote safe and responsible shipping  in the Arctic  including by supporting efforts at the IMO  and the Arctic Council that complement the International  Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (known as the  “Polar Code”) and the ban on heavy fuel oil   in Arctic waters.    Across all areas of Canada’s multilateral cooperation   in the UN system  at the Arctic Council and under   the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement  it is   imperative that Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples  be meaningfully engaged in discussions when their  rights or interests could be potentially impacted.  We will continue to provide funding  to Indigenous Permanent Participant  organizations in Canada to engage  in this work. We will also advocate   alongside Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples  for the equal  treatment and inclusion of Indigenous  Knowledge and science.  In support of Fisheries and Oceans  Canada  we undertake to advocate  for the development of marine  protected areas and other effective  conservation measures in the central  Arctic Ocean under the Arctic Council   thereby enabling Arctic states to lead  by example in implementing the  UN agreement on marine biological  diversity in areas beyond   national jurisdiction.  38  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Adopting a more inclusive  approach to Arctic diplomacy  1.\\tEnsuring\\tArctic\\tdiplomacy\\tis\\tinformed\\tby\\tand\\tbenefits\\tArctic\\t   and northern Indigenous Peoples and other northerners   The Arctic is home to more than 4 million people   including Indigenous Peoples who have inhabited the  region for thousands of years. Canada is committed to  a more inclusive approach to this foreign policy that  ensures people living in the North  including Indigenous  peoples  can participate in international decision making  on matters that affect their rights or interests.  Arctic diplomacy should be informed by and benefit  Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples and other  northerners. We remain committed to this goal and  will strengthen our efforts in this area  building on the  approach adopted in the ANPF to remain open to  holding discussions within more appropriate   distinctions-based frameworks  like the Inuit-Crown   Partnership Committee.   To move forward  Canada acknowledges the damaging  impacts of colonialism on the Indigenous Peoples   of Canada’s Arctic and North. Grounded in a commitment  to reconciliation  this policy seeks to build in the Arctic  foreign policy space a renewed Inuit-Crown and   nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous Peoples  based on the recognition of rights  respect  cooperation   and partnership.  Our work on this foreign policy will be guided by the  United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous  Peoples; treaties  including land claims agreements;  self-government agreements with Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples; and the Inuit Nunangat Policy.7  Canada’s Arctic foreign policy will also be guided  by respect for territorial and provincial jurisdiction   including the devolution agreements with the Northwest  Territories  Nunavut and the Yukon.  7\\t The\\tInuit\\tNunangat\\tPolicy\\trecognizes\\tInuit\\tNunangat\\tas\\ta\\tdistinct\\tgeographic \\tcultural\\tand\\tpolitical\\tregion\\tthat\\tforms\\t40%\\tof\\tCanada’s\\tland\\tarea \\t  \\t nearly\\tthree-quarters\\tof\\tits\\tcoastline\\tand\\tsignificant\\toffshore\\tareas.\\tIt\\talso\\tacknowledges\\tInuit\\tTreaty\\tOrganizations’\\tright\\tto\\trepresent\\tthemselves\\tnationally\\t  \\t and\\tinternationally\\tand\\tthat\\tstructurally\\tthey\\tmay\\tchoose\\tInuit\\tTapiriit\\tKanatami\\tand\\tthe\\tInuit\\tCircumpolar\\tCouncil\\tto\\trepresent\\tInuit\\tat\\tthe\\tnational\\t  \\t and\\tinternational\\tlevels\\trespectively.  39  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy i.  Arctic ambassador  The geopolitical landscape in the Arctic has become increasingly complex  and competitive. To ensure that the Canadian Arctic remains a region that  is stable  prosperous and secure  we need to deepen our engagement with  like-minded states  as well as with territorial and provincial governments   Indigenous Peoples and other domestic partners.  To lead this effort  we will establish the position of Arctic ambassador.  The ambassador’s responsibilities will include making linkages between domestic issues  and those relating to Canada’s foreign affairs; serving as Canada’s Senior Arctic Official and  advancing Canada’s polar interests in multilateral forums; engaging with counterparts in  Arctic and non-Arctic states  as well as with Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic; and raising  awareness internationally of Indigenous rights in the Arctic context. The ambassador will  also support the work of Global Affairs Canada and other departments on Arctic research  security.  In carrying out these duties  the ambassador will work closely with Arctic and  northern Indigenous Peoples  territorial and provincial governments and other northerners.   The ambassador will serve as a representative in our diplomatic corps and distinguish  himself or herself by ensuring that the Arctic Foreign Policy remains connected to the reality  of Canadians living in the Arctic. The ambassador will also play an important role in Canada’s  broader efforts toward reconciliation. The ambassador will have an office in Canada’s North.

Northern and Indigenous diplomacy      on the world stage  Canada remains committed to providing international  platforms for northerners  including territorial  provincial  and Indigenous partners and youths  to engage in and to  represent their own international Arctic views  especially  on issues that impact their rights or jurisdiction. Canada  also welcomes made-in-the-North initiatives to support  homegrown policy development that enhances northern  and Indigenous diplomacy on the world stage.    a. Sub-national governments  Arctic and northern public governments play a strategic  role in Canada’s Arctic diplomacy efforts. Canada  remains committed to including territorial government  officials in the Canadian delegation to Arctic   Council meetings.     b.  Arctic and northern Indigenous diplomacy  The Arctic Foreign Policy recommits to enhancing the  representation and participation of Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples in relevant negotiations and  international forums  such as the Arctic Council and the  United Nations  including the UN Permanent Forum on  Indigenous Issues  and all other bodies that Arctic and  northern Indigenous Peoples judge to affect them.  We have heard clearly from Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners that they are looking for more than  a platform where they are only one voice consulted  among many. Instead  Indigenous partners require and  demand meaningful continuous engagement to actively  partake in and shape decision making at the international  level that reflects their roles as rights holders. We will   uphold the role of Arctic and northern Indigenous   Peoples as active partners in the conduct of interna- tional relations in the Arctic and support their efforts   to advance this goal.  The Arctic Athabaskan Council  Gwich’in Council   International and the Inuit Circumpolar Council currently  sit at the Arctic Council as Permanent Participants   with membership from Canada.  Since 2020  Canada has increased funding to the   3 Permanent Participants in Canada  allowing each of  them to receive up to $650 000 each year. This support  is strengthening Indigenous voices in international Arctic  matters  particularly at the Arctic Council.  With Transport Canada  we will  support opportunities for the Inuit  Circumpolar Council Canada to  represent Inuit Knowledge and  perspectives in international forums   including on Arctic shipping and  environmental matters at the IMO.  Canada will also support similar efforts by other Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples to increase their  representation at relevant international forums to  ensure their rights and perspectives inform decision  making at the global level. Canada will work with   Indigenous partners to identify possible ways of   improving the capacity and role of Indigenous Peoples   in international Arctic affairs.   Canada remains strongly committed to the ANPF’s  objective of providing Arctic and northern youths with  additional opportunities to participate in  and benefit  from  Canada’s international Arctic agenda. We have  leveraged support for UArctic (an international network  of universities  colleges  research institutes and other  organizations concerned with education and research in  and about the Arctic) to provide opportunities for Canadi- ans to study in different parts of the circumpolar Arctic  to  generate regional solutions and to support collaboration  in Indigenous research and education.  41  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Photos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  iii. Northern and Indigenous representation      at Global Affairs Canada  Indigenous Peoples and northerners are   underrepresented at Global Affairs Canada  and   sustained efforts are needed to boost recruitment   and retention.  In line with the Future of Diplomacy  the department is  developing a new external recruitment strategy that will  be launched in 2025. The strategy will support outreach  across Canada to identify Canadians with the skills   needed to deliver on our various mandates and will  include specific outreach to under-represented   communities  including among Indigenous Peoples   and northerners.  To support our recruitment efforts and  increase Indigenous perspectives in the  department  we will establish a paid  Arctic and northern Indigenous youth  internship program that will consider  the need of Arctic and northern  Indigenous youths to remain close   to their families and communities   and ensure that appropriate support   is in place.  We will also work with partners to  identify other avenues for increasing  the representation of Indigenous  Peoples and northerners at Global  Affairs Canada.   42  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Advancing Indigenous    and northern foreign    policy priorities  Broadening Canada’s international engagement to   contribute more directly to domestic issues  such as  closing socio-economic gaps  supporting infrastructure  development  enhancing knowledge of the North    protecting the Arctic environment and advancing   reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples  remains a priority.  Key issues include those described below.  i.  Cross-border mobility  First Nations  Inuit and Métis communities in Canada’s  Arctic and North share long-standing spiritual  cultural   political  economic  social and family connections with  Indigenous communities in the United States and Green- land. The introduction of modern international borders  and the associated controls on cross-border mobility  have negatively impacted Indigenous Peoples’ ability  to maintain familial  economic and cultural ties and  traditional practices.  Photos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  Canada has been working with  Indigenous partners and the United  States  Denmark and Greenland to find  solutions to address border crossing  and migration challenges faced by First  Nations  Inuit and Métis Peoples.   This commitment is reflected in Action  Plan Measure Shared Priorities 52 of the  Action Plan to implement the United  Nations Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples Act.   To address border mobility challenges  faced by First Nations  Inuit and Métis  Peoples who live in the United States   including Alaska  Canada intends  to bring forward legislation and  regulatory measures.  43  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii.   Market access  Indigenous Peoples also face unjustifiable barriers to  trade—barriers that also restrict international market  access to Indigenous-harvested and -produced goods   such as seal fur and ivory products.  The traditional harvesting of seals and other species by  Inuit and other Indigenous Peoples of Canada is both  a sustainable and a valuable contributor to Arctic and  northern communities. Trade barriers by key partners   such as the United States  the European Union and other  countries  have a broad detrimental impact on life in  Canada’s remote Arctic and northern communities.  In August 2024  Canada submitted  a response to the European  Commission’s review of its regulation  on the trade of seal products. Canada  requested that the European Union  repeal its regulations and replace  them with rules that offer access   to ethically and sustainably   harvested products.  Canada will continue to advocate  for a repeal of the seal product ban.  We will also promote awareness of  sustainable seal products and harvest  management by hosting officials-level  dialogues with Arctic countries and  Indigenous partners at our missions   to the European Union and the   United States.

Indigenous Knowledge and participation  Canada supports Indigenous advocacy against pervasive  colonial approaches to Arctic science and research   which marginalize and discredit Indigenous Knowledge  and participation.  iv. Indigenous languages  Indigenous languages such as Inuktut8 are essential to  the preservation of Indigenous culture and the well-  being of Indigenous Peoples and communities. Canada  will therefore enhance its efforts to work with its Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners to facilitate the  exchange of knowledge and best practices related   to Indigenous language assessment  monitoring   and revitalization.  We will continue to support  equitable research partnerships  at the international level between  Indigenous and non-Indigenous  researchers  such as the Canada–Inuit  Nunangat–United Kingdom Arctic  Research Programme.  Looking forward  we will continue  to contribute to federal efforts on  a broader range of northern and  Indigenous priorities  and we will  collaborate with Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners  territorial  and provincial governments and  other northerners on international  advocacy as appropriate. This includes  promoting investment in critical  minerals development; transportation;  energy and electrification; broadband  connectivity; cultural diplomacy; and  the conservation of the Porcupine  caribou herd. We will also work with  Indigenous partners  Canadian Heritage  and other relevant government  departments to advocate for the  repatriation from across the globe of  artifacts originating from First Nations   Inuit and Métis communities.  8\\t Inuktut\\tis\\tthe\\tfirst\\tlanguage\\tused\\tin\\tInuit\\tNunaat \\tand\\tthe\\tmajority\\tof\\tInuit\\tNunaat\\tresidents\\tcontinue\\tto\\tspeak\\tInuktut\\tas\\ttheir\\tfirst \\tonly\\tor\\tpreferred\\tlanguage.\\t  \\t Therefore \\tto\\tuphold\\tthe\\tinherent\\tdignity\\tof\\tInuit \\tsupporting\\tInuktut\\tin\\tthis\\tcontext\\tas\\ta\\tfirst\\tor\\tlater\\tlanguage\\taligns\\twith\\tthe\\tbroader\\tpurposes\\tof \\tamong\\t  \\t other\\tthings \\tworking\\tin\\tpartnership\\tto\\tdemonstrate\\tand\\tpromote\\tshared\\trespect\\tfor\\tthe\\thistory\\tand\\timportance\\tof\\tInuktut\\tand\\tfor\\tsocio-economic\\t  \\t and\\tcultural\\tdevelopment.  45  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy v.   Supporting northern and Indigenous      trade and export  In line with Canada’s inclusive approach to trade and   its Export Diversification Strategy  we are committed   to supporting northern and Indigenous exporters in   accessing global markets.  The Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) recognizes that  building strong relationships with our northern and  Indigenous partners is key to this mission. Dedicated  trade commissioners  based in regional offices for British  Columbia and the Yukon; Alberta and the Northwest   Territories; Quebec and Nunavut; Manitoba and  Saskatchewan; and Atlantic Canada  work closely with  Canadian businesses in the Arctic and northern regions  to support their global expansion. The TCS network  also continues to actively support and develop tailored  programming for northern and Indigenous exporters   including through business delegations and export  training and accelerator programs  among other ways.  Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) into northern  and Indigenous communities will also play a vital role in  economic and infrastructure development in the region.  Through our increasing engagement with Northern and  Indigenous communities via the CanExport Community  Investments program  we will continue to support  municipalities and economic development organizations  in seeking and retaining FDI in the North while ensuring  that Canada’s environmental and national security   interests are protected.    3.  Transforming Global    \\tAffairs\\tCanada’s\\tdomestic\\t   engagement processes  We are committed to pursuing an ongoing collaborative  approach to domestic engagement that is informed by  early  sustained and meaningful engagement with   territorial and provincial governments  Arctic and   northern Indigenous governments and organizations   and northerners more generally.  46  The Arctic Cooperation Advisory  Committee is a Canadian forum  for the engagement of relevant  federal departments  territorial  and provincial governments and  Permanent Participant partners on the  development and implementation of  Canada’s international Arctic policy   including Arctic-Council-related  matters. It will remain an important  mechanism for dialogue and  engagement on the development and  implementation of Canada’s Arctic  Foreign Policy.   We are committed to exploring  distinctions-based engagements with  First Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty  and Self-Governing Partners from  Canada’s Arctic and North.  For example  we are committed to  engaging directly with Inuit through the  Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee as  we apply the Inuit Nunangat Policy to  our programs  policies and services.  In addition  we will expand  opportunities for territorial and  provincial governments and Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners to  join or support Canadian delegations  at bilateral or international Arctic  meetings and treaty negotiations if  in  such meetings and negotiations  their  rights or interests could potentially   be impacted.   We will also continue to provide a  critical coordination function for  multi-stakeholder Arctic events to  support a strong Canadian presence.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy CONCLUSION  The Arctic is a region of tremendous opportunity thanks  to its plentiful resources and resilient people.   However  Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine  rapidly   advancing climate change and increasing interest in  the Arctic from non-Arctic states has led to increased  competition and geopolitical tension in the region.   To ensure that the Arctic remains stable  prosperous and  secure and to fully implement the objectives laid out  in the International chapter of the ANPF  Canada needs  a diplomatic strategy that responds to this evolving  geopolitical context.  The Arctic Foreign Policy reorients Canada’s approach  to the Arctic based on a clear-eyed assessment of the  threats Canada faces today  and those it anticipates in  the future. It aligns Canada’s foreign and defence policy  to ensure the security of Canadians and ensures that  together with its allies  Canada can guard against and  defend itself against threats from its adversaries   in the Arctic.  By reinforcing the pillars of Arctic governance and the  principles of the rules-based international order  this  policy will help to safeguard the collective interests   of the peoples of the Arctic from those who would   seek to impose their wills.   This policy will strengthen our relationships with   territorial and provincial governments  Arctic and   northern Indigenous governments and organizations   and other northerners. It will produce new and more  effective ways of working together on Arctic diplomacy  that will transform Canada’s approach   to international engagement.  Canadian diplomacy has a role to play in building  renewed relationships with First Nations  Inuit  Métis   Modern Treaty and Self-Governing Partners; relationships  that are based on the recognition of rights  respect   and partnership.  The Arctic Foreign Policy is built on a vision of shared  cooperation and prosperity for all the peoples of the  Arctic who are committed to peace and stability.   Together  we can realize this future and ensure Canada’s  place as a leader in the Arctic for generations to come.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  47  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Annex: Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   development process and Canada’s Arctic   and\\tNorthern\\tPolicy\\tFramework\\t(ANPF) \\t  published in 2019  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   development process  In the spirit of the principle of “nothing about us without  us ” the Arctic Foreign Policy was developed on the basis  of extensive and distinctions-based engagement and  on collaboration and cooperation with domestic rights  holders from Canada’s Arctic and North  including First  Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-Governing  Partners and organizations; the territorial governments  (the Northwest Territories  Nunavut and the Yukon);  and provincial governments (Manitoba  Newfoundland  and Labrador and Quebec). We engaged partners in a  variety of formats  including bilateral meetings  regional  round-table discussions and ANPF   governance mechanisms.  The Arctic Foreign Policy is guided by all relevant  treaties and self-government agreements with Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners  including obligations  Canada has to Indigenous Peoples under those treaties  and agreements  and the rights recognized and affirmed  under section 35 of the Constitution Act  1982. It is further  guided by the Yukon Northern Affairs Program   Devolution Transfer Agreement (2003)  the Northwest  Territories Devolution Agreement (2014)  the United  Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  (endorsed by Canada in 2020)  the Inuit Nunangat Policy  (2022) and the Nunavut Lands and Resources Devolution   Agreement (2024).  The policy development process was also informed by  engagement with like-minded Arctic states; specifically   the Kingdom of Denmark  Finland  Iceland  Norway   Sweden and the United States.    48  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   Canada’s ANPF  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy complements and  supports the implementation of the ANPF  which was  published in 2019. The ANPF was co-developed with  over 25 First Nations  Inuit and Métis governments and  organizations  as well as with territorial and   provincial governments.   The ANPF sets out a common vision of a future where  Arctic and northern peoples are thriving  strong and  safe. The framework includes a co-developed policy  statement and the whole-of-government International  chapter  which articulates Canada’s goals and objectives  for the circumpolar Arctic in 3 key areas that   remain in effect:  1. Strengthening the rules-based   international order in the Arctic   2. More clearly defining Canada’s    Arctic boundaries   3. Broadening Canada’s international    engagement to contribute to the priorities   of the Canadian Arctic   The implementation of the International chapter has  been supported by Global Affairs Canada’s Global   Arctic Leadership Initiative with an annual budget   of $7 million each year to strengthen Canada’s global   leadership in the Arctic.  The ANPF’s Safety  security and defence chapter also  underlines the importance of strengthening cooperation  with international partners on safety  security   and defence issues.  Canada remains committed to strengthening Arctic   and northern infrastructure and to closing infrastructure  gaps with other regions of Canada to forge opportunities   for economic development  to address reconciliation    to increase resilience and to contribute to Arctic defence  and security.

It also   complements  and benefits from  the historic investments  Canada is making in its national defence and security  through its 2024 defence policy update Our North    Strong and Free.   It will make Canada more secure  especially for Canadians  living in the North. It will support strong and resilient Arctic  and Northern communities. It will also serve to advance the  interests and priorities of Indigenous Peoples and   northerners who call the Arctic home.  Canada’s new policy is based on a shared vision of the   Arctic’s future; I am confident Canada will realize its   ambitions through this policy.  The Honourable Mélanie Joly  P.C.  M.P.  Minister of Foreign Affairs  Canada is at an inflection point in the Arctic.   For many years  Canada has aimed to manage the Arctic  and northern regions cooperatively with other states as a  zone of low tension that is free from military competition  This approach had significant benefits  uniting the Arctic  nations to advance cooperation on issues of common  interest  such as sustainable development  environmental  protection and scientific collaboration  including through   the establishment of the Arctic Council in Ottawa in 1996.  However  the guardrails that we have depended on to  prevent and resolve conflict have weakened. Russia’s illegal  war in Ukraine has made cooperation with it on Arctic issues  exceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future. Uncertainty  and unpredictability are creating economic consequences  that Canadians are facing everyday.  Threats to Canada’s security are no longer bound by  geography; climate change is accelerating rapidly; and  non-Arctic states  including China  are also seeking greater  influence in the governance of the Arctic. To respond   Canada must be strong in the North American Arctic  and  it requires deeper collaboration with its greatest ally  the  United States. Canada must also maintain strong ties with   its 5 Nordic allies  which are now also all NATO members.  The evolving security and political dynamics in the   Arctic have triggered a need for a recalibrated diplomatic  approach to advancing Canada’s national interests in the  region  based on the principles of pragmatic diplomacy.   The Arctic Foreign Policy  a diplomatic strategy  addresses  the challenges and opportunities Canada faces today  as  well as those it expects to face in the coming decades. It  gives Canada the diplomatic tools it needs to continue to  assert its sovereignty  advance its national security interests  and promote a stable  prosperous and secure Arctic.   This policy is built on  and benefits from  the knowledge  and perspectives of Indigenous Peoples who call the Arctic  home. It comes from a place of understanding that there is  a dark chapter in Government of Canada policy in the Arctic   which includes forced relocations of Inuit to the High Arctic  and other colonial policies. These have inflicted significant  intergenerational trauma on Indigenous Peoples.   2  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Foreword: Message from   the\\tMinister\\tof\\tNorthern\\tAffairs  The new Arctic Foreign Policy will expand and broaden  Canada’s international engagement  strengthen relations  with our international partners and exercise Canada’s   sovereignty in the Canadian Arctic. It will also advance  domestic priorities  including enhancing knowledge of   the North  protecting the Arctic environment  and   advancing reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples   throughout the North.   By placing the invaluable perspectives  knowledge  and  wisdom of Indigenous Peoples in the North  who have  called the Arctic home since time immemorial  at the  foreground this new policy and its implementation  we will  ensure that the Arctic remains a vibrant  prosperous  and  secure region now and for future generations.

Minister of Northern Affairs  Released in 2019  the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework  (‘the Framework’) was co-developed with over 25 First  Nations  Inuit  and Métis governments  organizations   and territorial and provincial governments. It laid out a  shared vision to ensure that the needs and priorities of the  North remain paramount: “Strong  self-reliant people and  communities working together for a vibrant  prosperous and  sustainable Arctic and northern region at home and abroad   while expressing Canada’s enduring Arctic sovereignty.”   The launch of Canada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy builds on  the International Chapter of the Framework and is a pivotal  moment in the realization of our shared vision for the Arctic.  Informed by engagements with Indigenous Peoples and  Northerners and their vast knowledge in the region  as well  as with territorial and provincial governments  this Policy  reflects the federal government’s international approach to  the Arctic to ensure that Canada remains well-positioned   as an Arctic leader.   The Arctic Foreign Policy will promote a safe  strong    and thriving future for those who live in the Arctic and   the North  while protecting Canada’s enduring Arctic   sovereignty. It considers the shifting geopolitical context  and puts forward plans to ensure that the Canadian Arctic  remains strong and adaptable on the international stage   now and into the future. Just as Indigenous partners are  instrumental in the ongoing implementation of the   Framework  the success of this new foreign policy will  depend on continued learning from the immeasurable  experience  knowledge  and wisdom of First Nations  Inuit   Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-Governing partners and  communities. This shared learning is critical to a strong and  sustainable Arctic and to the full and effective implemen- tation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples Act.   Through this Policy  Canada’s approach to the Arctic will be  developed with respect for Indigenous self-determination  and the values  interests  cultures  and traditions of Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples  including weaving   traditional knowledge into Arctic decision-making   at the global level.   3  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Foreword: Message from   the Minister of National Defence  Canada remains committed to contributing to NATO   and NORAD’s awareness of the threat environment across  the Arctic region  including in the North American Arctic.   We likewise support the continued leadership of   like-minded Arctic states on matters of security   and defence.  The Arctic security and continental defence investments  made in Our North  Strong and Free and NORAD   Modernization support NATO’s deterrence and   defence agenda by protecting the Alliance’s Northern   and Western flanks. It ensures that Canada can engage   in the world and deploy from a secure base in support   of NATO allies  when needed.  As we expand and enhance our presence in the Arctic  we  recognize that this will also impact the communities who  inhabit the region. Indigenous Peoples have called the  Arctic home since time immemorial  and working with them  will enhance the prosperity and defence of the region.   Our government will continue to prioritize working with   Indigenous communities in the Arctic and deepening   our relationship with them.  As the world continues to evolve and threats intensify    the connection between foreign policy and defence policy  must remain strong for the protection of our country   and our values. This Arctic Foreign Policy complements  Canada’s ongoing work in the region to expand our   presence and safeguard our sovereignty in the Arctic.   The Honourable William Sterling Blair  P.C.  C.O.M.  M.P.  Minister of National Defence  Canada has benefited enormously from our geography.  Surrounded by 3 oceans  and our closest ally to the south   our country has enjoyed a degree of protection that has  helped keep our borders safe and secure. That reality is  changing in the Arctic. Where the polar ice caps provided  physical protection  the region is now opening to the world  as it warms at 4 times the global average.  In the coming decades  the Arctic Ocean will become a vital  shipping route between Europe and Asia  while vast stores  of natural resources become increasingly accessible.   This growing access is already enticing nations to   the region  heightening security challenges and   geopolitical competition.   Canada must urgently strengthen our presence in the Arctic  and northern regions as our adversaries aspire to a greater  role in the region’s affairs. The physical threat of climate  change is compounded by challenges from authoritarian  states to the rules-based international order that Canada  and its allies strive to uphold. Simultaneously  the character  of conflict is changing with rapid technological and   cyber advances.     Canada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy responds to these  growing challenges by focusing on 3 key areas: asserting  Canada’s sovereignty  advancing our interests in the region   and promoting a stable  prosperous  and secure North.   The policy addresses current needs and challenges while   anticipating how the region will change in the coming  decades. It also provides the diplomatic tools we need  to partner with Northern communities to assert Canada’s  sovereignty and to support Arctic and Northern people   so that they can thrive and remain secure.  The Arctic Foreign Policy complements the work and   investments outlined in our new defence policy update   Our North  Strong and Free  which was developed in part as  a response to the emerging threats in the Arctic and around  the world. Our North  Strong and Free focuses on   Canadian values and strengths while underpinning   our Arctic and Northern sovereignty  strengthening our   diplomatic influence  and leveraging our world-leading  cyber and space talent. It reinforces our capabilities and  capacity in the region  in partnership with those   who live there.  4  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Executive summary  Canada is an Arctic nation.  Canada launched the co-developed Arctic and Northern  Policy Framework (ANPF) in 2019  which sets out a   common vision of the Arctic and the North  in which   the peoples there are thriving  strong and secure.   Since then  strategic competition has intensified across the  globe as major powers that do not share Canadian interests  and values seek to shape the international environment to  their advantage. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022   for example  has shaken the foundations of international  cooperation in the Arctic.   At the same time  the Arctic is experiencing the   considerable impacts of climate change  with significant   implications for the security of the communities and people  who live in the Arctic. By 2050  the Arctic Ocean will become  an increasingly viable shipping route between Europe and  Asia during the summer.  More than ever  the Arctic is a theatre of interest for many  non-Arctic states and actors aspiring for a greater role in  Arctic affairs. Canada’s adversaries also try to achieve   influence through non-military tactics  including cyber  activities  foreign interference and economic coercion.  The North American Arctic is no longer free from tension.  Canada must work even closer with its closest ally  the   United States  to maintain a secure North American  homeland. Canada should also be closer than ever   to its Nordic allies.  To respond to these emerging geopolitical dynamics   and to align more closely with the defence policy update   Our North  Strong and Free  Canada has developed  in   partnership with northern and Indigenous Peoples  the  Arctic Foreign Policy to supplement the International   chapter of the ANPF. This policy will help ensure that the  Arctic remains a stable  prosperous and secure region   for future generations.  The Arctic Foreign Policy provides new funding over   the next 5 years to ensure that Global Affairs Canada1   is fit-for-purpose in the Arctic. The policy also benefits   Canadians who live in the Arctic and in the North    including by strengthening their ties and connections   across borders.   To achieve its objective of a stable  prosperous and secure  Arctic  Canada will continue to assert its sovereignty. Canada  will also advance its national interests through pragmatic  diplomacy; lead on Arctic governance and multilateral  challenges; and adopt a more inclusive approach   to Arctic diplomacy.  As part of this policy  Canada will:    appoint an Arctic ambassador     open a new consulate in Anchorage  Alaska    open a new consulate in Nuuk  Greenland    initiate an Arctic security dialogue with the ministers   of foreign affairs of like-minded states in the Arctic    expand information sharing with relevant territorial and  provincial governments and Indigenous leaders on  emerging and developing international Arctic security  trends  including foreign interference threats    support science and research coordination initiatives   with foreign policy considerations as related to research  security and science in the Arctic     launch boundary negotiations with the United States   regarding the Beaufort Sea and finalize the implementa- tion of the boundary agreement between Canada   and the Kingdom of Denmark regarding Tartupaluk   (Hans Island)  Canada remains deeply committed to the full implementa- tion of the ANPF  to Arctic state primacy and to upholding  the rules-based international order2 in the Arctic. The Arctic  Foreign Policy will provide new tools for Canada to deliver  on the objectives set out in the ANPF in a changing   geopolitical context.  This foreign policy will secure its national interests   and ensure stability and prosperity for the Indigenous   Peoples who live in the Arctic and the North—including   First Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-  Governing Partners—and other northerners. Canada’s  diplomacy is stronger when it is informed by Indigenous  Knowledge  culture and practices  as well as by the lived  experiences of northerners who call the Arctic home.  1\\t Hereafter \\tall\\tuses\\tof\\tthe\\tfirst-person\\tplural—we \\tus \\tour\\tand\\tours—are\\tin\\treference\\tto\\tGlobal\\tAffairs\\tCanada.  2\\tThe\\trules-based\\tinternational\\torder\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tis\\tthe\\tsum\\tof\\tinternational\\trules \\tnorms\\tand\\tinstitutions\\tthat\\tgovern\\tinternational\\taffairs\\tthere.  5  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy STRATEGIC  CHALLENGES   IN THE ARCTIC  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  6  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 1.  Russia     since 2022  Canada has been clear that there will be no business as usual with Russia  at the Arctic  Council or elsewhere  since its illegal  full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally changed the geopolitical  landscape  with spillover effects in the Arctic. It is an attack not only against Ukraine   but also on the fundamental principles of international relations  including respect   for sovereignty  territorial integrity and international law.   In addition to the existential threat Russian aggression poses to Ukraine and its people   Russian president Putin’s war on Ukraine risks setting a broader post-Cold-War   precedent that borders can be redrawn through violence.  Northerners understand how close a neighbour Russia is. Canada must be clear-eyed  about the implications of its geographic proximity to Russia. Canadian Forces Station  Alert  on Ellesmere Island  Nunavut  is closer to the Russian military’s air force base   at Nagurskoye  Russia  than Iqaluit is to Ottawa or Toronto is to Winnipeg.   For over a decade  Russia has invested in modernizing its Arctic infrastructure and its  military capabilities in the Arctic to develop resources and control access to the region   with particular emphasis on its own western region and approaches. It is looking to  profit from climate change in the region and will continue promoting the development  of the Northern Sea Route as a major international shipping route. Given the strategic  importance Russia places on its Arctic region  Canada expects these activities   will continue.  Russia has also intensified its disinformation campaigns  conducted below-threshold  military activities3  and crafted a vehement domestic narrative of a “hostile  unfriendly  West ” in part to justify its own militarization of the Arctic.   Russia’s historic posture has been to ensure sovereignty and control over its own Arctic  region and to limit the role of non-Arctic states in Arctic affairs. However  because of  sanctions and of its massive expenditures on its illegal war against Ukraine  Russia  is increasingly reliant on China to fund and support the development of its projects  in the Arctic. These include investments in Arctic research  oil and gas development   ports and other critical infrastructure. We anticipate this trend will continue and lead to  increased activity by China in the Russian Arctic.   Russia and China are aligned in their desire to undermine the liberal-rules-based  international system  but the power asymmetry between them often highlights the  divergence in their interests. Russia is increasingly dependent on China and is reversing  its historic posture by opening its Arctic to China. For instance  in July 2024  Russia and  China  building on their 2022 statement to cooperate in the Arctic  conducted joint  military exercises in the Russian High North. In addition  Russian and Chinese warships  have conducted joint patrols in international waters off the Aleutian Islands; the   2 countries’ coast guards have conducted joint patrols into the Bering Sea; and Russian  and Chinese military aircraft have been detected  tracked and intercepted by the North  American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) while flying in Alaska’s Air Defense  Identification Zone. This demonstrates the continued deepening of Chinese-Russian  military cooperation  particularly in the North Pacific approaches to the Arctic.  3\\t\\t“Below-threshold\\tconflict ”\\talso\\tknown\\tas\\t“grey\\tzone\\tconflict ”\\trefers\\tto\\tcompetitive\\tinteraction\\tbetween\\tstates\\tthat\\tfalls\\t  \\t short\\tof\\ttraditional\\tarmed\\tconflict\\tbut\\tgoes\\tbeyond\\tnormal\\tpeaceful\\trelations.\\tSuch\\tconflict\\tinvolves\\tactions\\tthat\\tare\\t  \\t coercive\\tand\\taggressive\\tbut\\tdeliberately\\tdesigned\\tto\\tremain\\tbelow\\tthe\\tthreshold\\tof\\tarmed\\tconflict.\\tThese\\tactions\\t  \\t could\\tinclude:\\tinformation\\twarfare\\tand\\tpropaganda;\\tcyber\\tattacks\\tand\\tespionage;\\teconomic\\tcoercion;\\tpolitical\\t  \\t interference\\tand\\telection\\tmeddling;\\tthe\\tuse\\tof\\tproxy\\tforces\\tor\\tparamilitary\\tgroups;\\tor\\t“lawfare”\\tand\\t  \\t exploiting\\tlegal\\tambiguities.  7  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Evolving    security    threats across    the Arctic  8  The Arctic is a strategically important region for the defence of North America and the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO’s) northern and western flanks. However    the defence architecture and threat picture differ across the circumpolar north.   The safety  security and defence of the Canadian Arctic comprise a fundamental  priority for the Government of Canada and are critical to the collective defence of North  America. The Arctic regions of North America are protected by the armed forces of  Canada and the United States  individually and bilaterally  and through NORAD    which is binational.  While the risk of military attack in the North American Arctic remains low  the region  represents a geographic vector for traditional and emerging weapons systems  that threaten broader North American and transatlantic security. Canada is seeing  a number of potential threats  including increased Russian activity in Canadian air  approaches  China’s regular deployment of dual-use—having both research and  military application—research vessels and surveillance platforms to collect data  and a  general increase in Arctic maritime activity. Adversaries and competitors also employ  disinformation and influence campaigns  malicious cyber operations and espionage  and foreign interference activities to target Canadians  including northerners.  Close partnership with the United States is essential to the maintenance of a secure   strong and well-defended North American homeland  on which the 2 countries’ mutual  prosperity depends. It is critical in deterring and defending against increasingly sophis- ticated threats to North America  including in the Arctic and its approaches in the North  Atlantic and North Pacific. We expect Canada–United States defence cooperation in  the Arctic to continue to grow  as it is fundamental to both countries’ national   security interests.  Strong and resilient Arctic and northern communities increase Canada’s defence  against threats. With increased tension and with competitors looking to exploit  vulnerabilities in the Canadian North  Canada must take action to build trust in public  institutions and deepen ties with like-minded states. Canada’s diplomacy and defence  and security policies must work hand in hand to keep these emerging threats in check.  The security of the European High North is also of critical importance to Canada’s  security and economic well-being.  The European High North is a contested region militarily  including threats to critical  infrastructure  maritime security  and safety  as well as access concerns. Russia has  established a strong military presence in the Arctic  including with air and naval   platforms equipped with missile systems capable of striking Europe and North   America and of disrupting Canada’s ability to project forces in support of allies and  partners. Russia’s below-threshold actions  military activities and continued weapons  testing in the European High North and the Arctic are deeply troubling.  NATO has strengthened its deterrence and defence posture  including in the European  High North  in response to the increased threat posed by Russia. The accessions of  Finland and Sweden to NATO  in 2023 and 2024 respectively  reinforced the Alliance by  bringing  among other things  their significant cold-weather experience and capabilities  to NATO  thereby bolstering its strategic posture in the European High North. Canada  was the first country to ratify each of their accessions. Canada will continue to share  information on threats in the Arctic with allies and to support NATO operations and  presence in the European High North.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Despite the changing threat picture  it is not in Canada’s strategic interest that the Arctic  becomes a theatre of military conflict. Canada will continue working with territorial   and provincial governments  Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples and allies and   partners throughout the Arctic region to enhance domain awareness  improve   information sharing and strengthen interoperability and research security.  Canada must also take action to mitigate the impact that current and emerging  defence and security threats to the Arctic have on the people who live in the region  and who now find themselves at the frontlines of geopolitical competition.

Adapting    to new    dynamics    for Arctic   governance  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has had cascading impacts on the governance of the  Arctic. While Arctic states continue to fulfill the important responsibility of governing  the Arctic region at a time of unprecedented change  like-minded countries are taking  coordinated action to ensure it is not business as usual with Russia.  The Arctic Council is the pre-eminent forum for international Arctic cooperation   and governance. It brings together the 8 Arctic states  the 6 Permanent Participant   organizations representing Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic  and observers to address   sustainable development and the environmental protection of the Arctic. The role  of Arctic Indigenous Peoples  from the foundation of the Arctic Council in 1996 to  the present  is one of the council’s greatest strengths and is unique in multilateral  governance. The council sets the bar for meaningful Indigenous engagement  which  continues to grow to this day. Arctic governance must be done with those who have  lived in the Arctic for thousands of years  recognizing the strength of shared knowledge  and decision making.   Meetings with all members of the council at the ministerial and Senior Arctic Official   levels remain on hold. Arctic states and Permanent Participants are working at the  expert and scientific level to advance important projects on climate change and  biodiversity  emergency prevention and preparedness and sustainable development.  These projects  along with the other work of the Arctic Council  are helping to drive  meaningful change for people who live across the Arctic. This unique work  done in  collaboration between the Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic and the Arctic states    is what makes the Arctic Council so valuable.  To ensure the maintenance of robust governance in the Arctic—governance that is  capable of tackling the increasing challenges and opportunities the region is facing— cooperation must continue at the Arctic Council. Canada must also identify new forums  and leverage existing ones in new ways to advance discussions on Arctic issues. Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples must be active partners in the conduct of   international relations in the Arctic.   Arctic states also meet in other regional and international forums that contribute to  upholding the rules-based international order  including the Arctic Coast Guard Forum  and the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement. The latter came into force in 2021   establishing a precautionary 16-year ban on commercial fishing on the high seas of   the Arctic Ocean.  Arctic states also play a leading role in advancing Arctic interests in broader global  efforts through the UN system  such as the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s)  ban on heavy fuel oil in the Arctic.  An extensive international legal framework applies to the Arctic Ocean. The law of  the sea  including as set out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)   determines states’ jurisdictions and their rights and obligations in various maritime  zones. These rules apply to the delineation of the outer limits of continental shelves   navigation  the management of natural resources  the protection of the marine environ- ment and other uses of the sea. Consistent with the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration4  Canada  remains committed to the orderly settlement of Arctic disputes in accordance with  international law and expects the same of other signatories  including Russia.  4\\t\\tThe\\tIlulissat\\tDeclaration\\twas\\tsigned\\tby\\tthe\\t5\\tArctic\\tOcean\\tcoastal\\tstates\\t(Canada \\tthe\\tUnited\\tStates \\tthe\\tKingdom\\tof\\t  \\t Denmark \\tNorway\\tand\\tRussia)\\tat\\tIlulissat \\tGreenland \\tin\\tMay\\t2008.\\tIn\\tthe\\tdeclaration \\tthe\\t5\\tstates\\tpledged\\tto\\tenhance\\t  \\t their\\tscientific\\tand\\tenvironmental\\tcooperation\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tOcean.\\tThey\\talso\\tcommitted\\tto\\tthe\\torderly\\tsettlement\\tof\\t  \\t overlaps\\tin\\ttheir\\trespective\\textended\\tcontinental\\tshelves \\tin\\taccordance\\twith\\tinternational\\tlaw.  11  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Canada has a clear interest in maintaining the structures of governance in   the Arctic that ensure Canada’s central role in guiding the region’s future.   Canada especially values the Arctic Council because it provides a platform   for Indigenous Peoples to help shape circumpolar affairs. Canada will not   allow Russia to undermine  through its actions  the pillars of international   cooperation in the Arctic.

Climate     change: the    overarching    threat  Climate change is both the most pressing and the most proximate threat to Canada’s  security in the Arctic and the people who live there. Its causes and effects are not  bound by countries’ official borders.  Climate change is progressing at an alarming pace  with the Arctic warming 4 times  faster than the global average  causing significant impacts on natural and human   environments. These impacts serve as threat multipliers because changing environ- mental conditions create additional opportunities for foreign adversaries and   competitors to covertly or overtly operate in the Canadian Arctic.  The total surface area of Arctic Ocean ice is shrinking  with varied implications for  maritime shipping  trade and resource extraction across the Arctic. Maritime traffic in  the Arctic will continue to increase  which will drive further foreign interest in the region.  This includes maritime traffic in Canada’s Arctic Archipelago  despite the risks and  hazards associated with the unpredictable ice conditions.  With retreating sea ice and new technologies improving navigation and accessibility   foreign activity in the Arctic will continue to increase  bringing with it related safety   security and environmental challenges. With other Arctic states  Canada must be  prepared to respond.  Climate change is also driving an increase in climate-related emergencies and   disrupting ecosystems that Arctic communities rely on for their livelihoods  with   significant implications for the security of northerners  including Indigenous Peoples   who are disproportionately affected by these changes.  Northerners  including Indigenous Peoples  have shared concerns about climate  change and their ongoing efforts to improve their resiliency in the face of increased  pressures on communities and livelihoods  food security and the destabilization of  critical and civilian infrastructure. The disappearance of year-round ice cover and  changes in the timing and durability of the floe edge; increasing subsidence due to  permafrost thaw; and a greater frequency and severity of wildfires are examples of the  impacts of climate change on Arctic communities  all of which have both material and  psychological impacts.  For instance  communities in the North are often impacted by major wildfires. In 2023   more than half of the population of the Northwest Territories had to be evacuated.   There is an ongoing need to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change in the  Arctic to reduce vulnerabilities. Canada must support Arctic and northern Indigenous  Peoples and other northerners in adapting to the environment as it is and will be—not  as one wishes it would be.   In parallel  climate change is driving interest in the Arctic as a sustainable and reliable  source of critical minerals  such as lithium  graphite  nickel  cobalt  copper and rare  earth elements integral to the transition to a low-carbon economy. For Canada and  its allies  the Arctic’s resource potential provides an opportunity to diversify critical  mineral production in partnership with territorial and provincial governments  Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples and local communities. This must be done carefully   respecting the livelihoods of local communities.   Climate change is a global problem; it requires global solutions and multilateral collaboration.  13  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 5.  Increasing     challenges to    Arctic states’    primacy  Canada’s approach to the Arctic is guided by the fundamental principle that the Arctic  should be governed by the Arctic states in collaboration with Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples. As in other regions  strategic competition in the Arctic is growing   with non-Arctic states and actors increasingly expressing foreign policy or security  aspirations  thereby pushing for greater roles in Arctic affairs.  Since 2019  there has been a growing narrative among some non-Arctic states that  they should have a greater say in Arctic governance. China  in particular  has expressed  an ambition to become a “polar great power ” by 2030.  Among China’s priorities in the Arctic are developing commercial shipping opportuni- ties  including a “Polar Silk Road ” as well as natural resource exploitation  including of  critical minerals  oil and gas and fish. China is also active in Arctic research  much   of which can be considered dual use.  China seeks to shape the international order into a more permissive environment for  interests and values that increasingly deviate from Canada’s commitment to a rules- based international system. China can be expected to use all the tools at its disposal   to advance its geopolitical interests  including in the Arctic. Canada will challenge China  when it ought to and cooperate when its interests align with China’s.  China  like all states  has rights and responsibilities related to its use of the world’s  oceans that apply equally in the Arctic. For example  in accordance with UNCLOS   China can only conduct marine scientific research in the exclusive economic zone  of another state with the consent of that state. Canada will carefully review any such  requests related to its own exclusive economic zone and provide or withhold consent  consistent with the provisions of the convention.  14  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   Photo Credit: © Global Affairs  Canada  Consistent with its Indo-Pacific Strategy and in collaboration with partners  Canada will  always act on matters of Arctic governance to protect national and northern interests   including when dealing with China. Canada will cooperate with China to address   pressing global issues—such as climate change—that have impacts on the Arctic.  In the Canadian Arctic  Canada will always work to protect Canada’s economic security   safeguard Canadian values and protect Canadians from malign influence.  Canada will continue to work closely with the United States to counter all forms   of malign influence and activity in the North American Arctic.   In the wider region  Canada will always uphold the founding principles that under- pinned the Ottawa Declaration in 1996 on the establishment of the Arctic Council.  These include Canada’s commitment to the well-being of the inhabitants of the Arctic;  its commitment to sustainable development in the Arctic region  including economic  and social development  improved health conditions and cultural well-being; its   commitment to the protection of the Arctic environment; and its commitment to  ensure full consultation with  and the involvement of  Indigenous Peoples and their   communities and other inhabitants of the Arctic on Arctic Council activities.  At all times  Canada’s engagement in the Arctic will be focused first and foremost on  promoting and defending Canadian national interests. Canada will adopt a pragmatic  approach when circumstances require it.  15  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ARCTIC FOREIGN  POLICY PILLARS  The Arctic Foreign Policy provides Global Affairs Canada  with additional diplomatic tools to support a stable   prosperous and secure Arctic and to fully implement   the objectives laid out in the International chapter of   the ANPF given the changing geopolitical context.  We will do this by continuing to assert Canada’s   sovereignty; advancing Canada’s national interests  through pragmatic diplomacy; leading on Arctic   governance and multilateral challenges; and adopting   a more inclusive approach to Arctic diplomacy.

Leveraging diplomacy to support national defence and security  The Government of Canada will continue to take a   comprehensive approach to Arctic security by prioritizing  the security  interests and priorities of the Arctic region  and northerners  as well as Canadians more broadly.  Canada’s foreign and defence policies are closely  intertwined and complementary. Effective diplomacy  is critical for shaping the international environment to  defend and advance Canadian national interests; it is   a first line of defence for Canada’s national security.   Canada’s fundamental defence and security goal is   to prevent and defuse potential crises before they can  develop into conflict.  Canada’s national security is also supported by human  security. Strong and resilient local communities are vital  to national defence.  Canada engages in the Arctic from a position of strength  thanks to the Canadian Armed Forces’ (CAF’s) presence  and capabilities  exercises and operations  including  those of the Canadian Rangers. Canadian Rangers are  active  well-respected members of their communities   and they play a critical role in demonstrating Canadian  sovereignty over the lands  waters and ice of Canada’s  North and Arctic.  Building on the NORAD modernization investments  announced in 2022  Canada’s defence policy update  Our North  Strong and Free identified the Government of  Canada’s most pressing priority as the continued asser- tion of Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and northern  regions. Canada is making investments to ensure that  the CAF has the capabilities required to operate in an  evolving geopolitical context. By 2030  Canada will have  almost tripled its defence spending from 2015.  Strengthened military capabilities will bolster the CAF’s  ability to conduct and sustain operations in the Arctic  and create opportunities for strengthened collaboration  with allies and partners. Canada regularly invites select  allies and partners to take part in Operation NANOOK   the CAF’s signature northern operation series. Canada  also works with allies and partners on multinational  research and development activities relevant to the  conduct of defence and security operations in   the polar regions.   In addition to NORAD modernization and the defence  policy update  Canada is pursuing historic investments  to increase its military capability in the maritime domain  in the Arctic. Ensuring that Canada’s internal waters in  the Arctic are well defended is a critical component of  maintaining a secure North American homeland. Canada  will maintain strong defence capabilities in its internal  Arctic waters  including in the Northwest Passage.   17  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Here is a summary of key defence   and security investments:    Several military capabilities will play a key role in   exercising Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and  northern waters  including Canada’s 6 new Arctic  Offshore Patrol Ships; up to 15 new River Class  Destroyers; 11 new MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones;   up to 16 new P-8A Poseidon multi-mission aircraft  specialized in anti-submarine and anti-surface  warfare; and 88 new F-35A fighter aircraft.     Canada’s $38.6 billion plan to modernize NORAD will  significantly enhance domain awareness in the Arctic  and the North through the establishment of a   new northern approaches surveillance system to   complement the North Warning System and further   investment in space-based surveillance. It also  includes further investment in space-based polar  communications; additional air-to-air refuelling aircraft  to support and extend the reach of CAF operations— and NORAD operations—in Canada; additional and  longer-range air-to-air missiles for Canada’s fighter  fleet; significant infrastructure upgrades at airfields  used to support NORAD forward operations; and   more than $4 billion in new funding for science   and technology.    The defence policy update announced an additional  $8.1 billion in spending over the next 5 years and   $73 billion over the next 20 years to support   Canada’s national defence and security in the Arctic.  This includes a new fleet of airborne early warning  and control aircraft; specialized maritime sensors   including some that can be deployed by Harry  DeWolf-class Arctic Offshore Patrol vessels; a new  fleet of tactical helicopters; and a new satellite  ground station in the Arctic to enhance the use of  Canadian  U.S. and other Allied space capabilities.     The defence policy update will also establish a new  network of Northern Operational Support Hubs to  further enhance the CAF’s presence  responsiveness  and partnerships across the Arctic and the North  and invest in multi-use infrastructure that also meets  the needs of the territories  Indigenous Peoples and  northern communities.    In July 2024  Canada announced it would initiate new  spending programs to put the country on track to  reach NATO’s target of 2% of GDP spending by 2032.  This will include the purchase of up to 12 convention- ally powered  under-ice-capable submarines by the  Royal Canadian Navy.    In 2024  the Government of Canada initiated the   procurement of 8 new icebreakers made in Canada  to support Canadian Coast Guard operations in the  Arctic  including 2 polar icebreakers that will enable  year-round icebreaker presence in the Arctic. The  icebreakers will contribute to the protection of the  marine environment  the resupplying of communities  and the collection of data that enhances Canada’s  maritime domain awareness in support of maritime  safety and security  climate resilience and   scientific research.    In July 2024  Canada  the United States and Finland   announced an enhanced trilateral partnership called  the ICE Pact. It is a collaborative effort to build best- in-class Arctic and polar icebreakers and other Arctic  and polar capabilities in each of the countries by  sharing expertise  information and capabilities. This  partnership also bolsters the ability of like-minded  nations to uphold international rules  norms and  standards to ensure safety and to sustain peace and  stability in the Arctic.  The diplomatic initiatives in the Arctic Foreign Policy will  complement all of these investments by better aligning  Canada’s strategic approaches and by strengthening  its relationships with its Arctic allies  with territorial and  provincial governments and with Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners.  18  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy i.  Bridging the intelligence gap  To address the complex range of threats faced in the  Arctic  Canada must conceptualize security not only in  military terms. Security in the Arctic includes community  security  research security  economic security  security  against disinformation and any other form of interference  and physical and digital infrastructure security.  We will work with Public Safety Canada to support efforts  to strengthen Canadian national resilience to counter  malign influence and activities of foreign powers. Canada  will strengthen the defence of its critical infrastructure  across the country  including in the Arctic  to protect  northern communities against foreign interference. This  can be achieved through the Investment Canada Act;  by strengthening Canadian cyber security systems; and  through new legislation to address foreign interference.  We will provide relevant territorial   provincial and Indigenous  governments with regular briefings  and information on emerging and  developing international security  trends  including threats affecting the  Arctic  to ensure that they are equipped  to support communities in Canada’s  Arctic and North and to make informed  decisions about the security of their  communities.  This will be achieved in collaboration  with the Canadian Security Intelligence  Service  the Communications Security  Establishment  the Department of  National Defence and Public   Safety Canada.

Global Affairs Canada will support the  work of Innovation  Science and Economic  Development Canada  Crown-Indigenous  Relations and Northern Affairs and its  portfolio agencies  the Department of  National Defence  Natural Resources  Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada   among others  to support the scientific  research permitting process in the Arctic   particularly for international applicants  undertaking research that can be  considered dual use.  To help ensure emerging challenges  concerning research security and science  collaboration in the North are addressed    we will help by increasing our capacity  to learn about concerns from those on  the ground  holding annual round-table  meetings on science and research relating  to Canada’s Arctic foreign policy priorities.  We will work closely with other federal  government departments and agencies   to organize the round-table meetings.  The Arctic ambassador (see Pillar 4 -  Adopting a more inclusive approach to  Arctic diplomacy) will work with Indigenous  Peoples and partners from territorial and  provincial governments  as well as across  the Government of Canada  to contribute  to the efforts to address climate change   biodiversity and other areas where  Indigenous Knowledge  science and  technologies could contribute solutions   to the challenges in the Arctic.  The Arctic ambassador will also work with  Canada’s Chief Science Advisor on issues  related to science and research.  20  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  ii.  Strengthening research security  International scientific collaboration plays an important  role in addressing gaps in knowledge of the Arctic  region  including in relation to climate change. The last  20 years have seen a marked increase in international  research activity across the Canadian and   circumpolar Arctic.   While Canada continues to welcome scientific   collaboration in the Arctic  Canada’s oversight  regu- latory  safety and security bodies must be equipped  to address potential threats and harms at all levels. In  particular  Canada must guard against foreign research  in the Canadian Arctic and North that is dual use—having  both research and military application.   This requires balancing between the important priority  of advancing recognized areas of needed international  scientific collaboration  such as climate change research   with necessary due diligence to protect Canada’s most  sensitive research.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy iii. Partnering with the Canadian Coast Guard      to support defence and security  The Canadian Coast Guard  alongside other partner  departments and agencies  is responsible for maritime  domain awareness and plays a critical role in supporting  the defence and security of the North.  Building on the Canadian Coast Guard Arctic Strategy   released in 2024  the Canadian Coast Guard will continue  to contribute to Canada’s national security  including  through its assistance to Arctic scientific   research expeditions.  The Canadian Coast Guard currently operates up to   6 icebreakers in the Arctic from June to November each  year  which helps advance maritime safety and security.  In the coming years  the Canadian Coast Guard will  acquire 8 new icebreakers  including 2 polar icebreakers  that will provide capacity for year-round presence   in the Arctic.  The Canadian Coast Guard also helps to deepen  Canadian defence cooperation with Arctic allies through  Operation Pacer Goose. The annual operation resupplies  the United States’ Pituffik Space Base (formerly known  as Thule Air Base) in Greenland  ensuring that essential  supplies are safely delivered in challenging   Arctic conditions.  To strengthen the interconnections  between the Arctic Foreign Policy  and the Canadian Coast Guard Arctic  Strategy  we will collaborate more  closely with the Canadian Coast  Guard to leverage its maritime  domain expertise and support its  work with international partners.  Through its operations and activities   the Canadian Coast Guard helps  contribute to stronger relationships with  Canada’s Arctic allies. Through deeper  collaboration  the Canadian Coast  Guard will also be able to expand its  partnerships with regional coast guards  from like-minded states.   21  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy iv. Strengthening regional defence      and security architectures  To respond to the evolving threat landscape in the Arctic   Canada will strengthen coordination and dialogue with  Arctic allies on security issues.  Alongside the Department of National Defence  we  will increase our information sharing with NATO on  circumpolar threats. We will improve interoperability and  increase the collective understanding of the evolving  security situation in the Arctic and enhance the Alliance’s  cold-weather capabilities. Canada will continue to be  an active participant in NATO exercises and operations   including in the European High North.  To ensure seamless situational awareness and informa- tion sharing on northern threats that do not recognize  borders or military command areas of responsibility   Canada supports greater coordination and collaboration  between the military forces of like-minded Arctic states   including in the context of NATO and NORAD activities.  Canada will explore and foster new partnerships to  strengthen the strategic resilience of the North American  Arctic  particularly with Alaska  the Yukon  the Northwest  Territories  Nunavut and Greenland.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  To complement existing defence forums  Canada is exploring opportunities to deepen  security dialogue among all like-minded states in the Arctic  including through regular  security discussions.    Canada will initiate an Arctic security dialogue with the ministers of foreign affairs of  like-minded states in the Arctic. Discussions will focus on sharing information on  and  on analyses of  issues relating to international Arctic relations and security; as well  as discussing national approaches to cross-cutting security challenges; advancing  opportunities for collaboration; and increasing collective resilience.  22  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Upholding the rules-based international order  The waters of Canada’s Arctic Archipelago  including   the various channels comprising the Northwest Passage   are internal waters of Canada by virtue of historic title  and in accordance with international law. Canada’s Arctic  sovereignty encompasses land  sea and ice. It extends  without interruption to the seaward-facing coasts of the  Arctic islands and beyond. These islands are joined  not  divided  by the waters between them and are bridged for  a large part of the year by ice.  Indigenous Peoples in Canada have used and occupied  the ice and waters as they have used and occupied  the lands for thousands of years. Every day  through a  wide range of activities  Arctic and northern Indigenous  Peoples and governments  as well as territorial and  provincial governments and other northerners  share  stewardship over the Arctic lands and waters of Canada.  It is through the reciprocal recognition of each other’s  mutual interests in these lands and waters that Canada  and Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples share in the  stewardship of them—further codified in modern treaties  and self-government agreements. Sovereignty and   sovereign rights in the Arctic are inextricably linked   to issues of Indigenous self-government. Canada   possesses environmental  economic  cultural and   historical interests unique to the region  the reality  and importance of which are clearly evidenced by  long-standing usage.  Canada will work with Arctic and  northern Indigenous partners to assert  shared interests and priorities in the  region  such as through partnerships  with the Inuit Marine Monitoring  Program and the Indigenous  Guardians program.5 These initiatives  provide Indigenous Peoples with  greater opportunities to exercise  responsibility for the stewardship of  their traditional lands  waters and ice.  Canada intends to continue to act as a responsible  sovereign of its Arctic territories and waters  relying on  the rules-based international order and supported by  historical and scientific evidence. Canada’s commitment  to ensuring that maritime claims are addressed in a  manner that is consistent with international law is one   of its key enduring priorities in the Arctic.

Managing Arctic boundaries through    a rules-based approach  At a time when the rules-based international order   is under unprecedented threat  it is critical that states  resolve their disputes responsibly  through dialogue  and negotiation. Canada has made resolving boundary  disputes in accordance with international law one of the  foundational principles of its foreign policy in the Arctic.  Enhanced international cooperation on maritime  boundaries also helps secure states’ respective national  interests over their resources  including energy  minerals   fish and wildlife.  Canada will advance efforts to resolve  Arctic boundary disputes peacefully  and in accordance with international  law  including UNCLOS  and in  consultation with Indigenous partners   particularly where these international  boundaries may affect treaty rights.  Canada–Kingdom of Denmark  boundary agreement  Canada  the Kingdom of Denmark  and  Greenland have resolved the maritime  boundary and long-time dispute over  Tartupaluk. In June 2022  following  5 years of intensive negotiations   the Canadian  Nunavut  Danish and  Greenlandic governments agreed  on a modernized single maritime  boundary  from the Lincoln Sea in  the north to the Labrador Sea in  the south—a distance of over 3 000  kilometres—which established the  longest bilateral maritime boundary  in the world. The agreement also  resolved the overlap in our respective  continental shelves in the Labrador Sea.  With the Kingdom of Denmark   Canada agreed to divide the island  of Tartupaluk roughly in half; Canada  is now advancing discussions on an  agreed border regime for Tartupaluk   which requires engagement with the  Government of Nunavut and local  Inuit communities. This is the last step  before the agreement can come into  force  which Canada is committed to  completing in the near future.  24  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Extended continental shelf  Canada–United States   Beaufort Sea boundary  In September 2024  Canada launched  negotiations with the United States to  resolve the 2 countries’ long-standing  maritime boundary dispute in the  Beaufort Sea. The area in question  is north of the Yukon and Alaska and  measures approximately 270 000  square kilometres. Both countries claim  jurisdiction over the disputed region  by way of differing legal interpretations  of the 1825 treaty between Russia and  Great Britain.  Reflecting the Government of Canada’s  commitment to partnership and  reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples   the boundary negotiations will involve  impacted Inuit Treaty Organizations and  close consultations with territorial and  Indigenous governments.   In December 2022  Canada filed  an addendum to its Arctic Ocean  extended continental shelf  submission with the Commission on  the Limits of the Continental Shelf  in response to Russia’s addendum   which was filed in March 2021. Russia’s  addendum greatly expanded the size  of the continental shelf included in its  submission and tripled the area that  overlaps with Canada’s own continental  shelf. Canada’s 2022 addendum  rebalanced the overlap area.  In December 2023  the United  States published the outer limits  of its extended continental shelf  in the western Arctic Ocean. This  announcement offers an opportunity  for Canada to renew negotiations  with the United States regarding the  overlap of the countries’ respective  continental shelves. These discussions  are expected to begin in late 2024.  Canada  like all Arctic Ocean coastal  states  remains committed to settling  continental shelf overlap areas  peacefully and in accordance   with international law.  25  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Advancing Canada’s interests   through pragmatic diplomacy  A fundamental principle of Canadian foreign policy is that the Arctic   should be governed by the Arctic states. This has long been a shared   principle of the Arctic states and has produced a long period    of peaceful cooperation and development in the region.   1. Strengthening Canada’s partnerships with Arctic allies  i.  The United States   The United States is Canada’s closest partner and ally   in the Arctic  and this collaboration extends across many  shared interests. Collaboration is advanced by Canada’s  extensive diplomatic network of 13 missions across the  United States and through various bilateral mechanisms.  With the United States  Canada shares a unique   relationship shaped by geography  history  shared values   common interests and strong people-to-people connec- tions. This is especially the case in the Arctic  particularly  among Indigenous Peoples  whose history  culture and  connections transcend national borders.   The Canada–United States defence partnership is  essential to maintaining a secure North American   homeland. Canada welcomes the continued partici- pation of the United States’ military and coast guard in  Canada-led exercises and operations in Canada’s   Arctic and North.  Going forward  Canada will continue to advance bilateral cooperation with the United  States in the North at all levels of government in existing areas of importance and explore  new avenues of cooperation in critical areas of national interest  including: security and  safety; the defence of North America; science and research technology; energy security;  supply chains; climate change; critical minerals; sustainable development; Indigenous  cross-border mobility; economic development; marine and terrestrial conservation; and the  protection of transboundary species  including salmon and the Porcupine caribou herd.  26  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii.   The Nordic states  Canada maintains close relations with its Nordic Arctic  neighbours; specifically  the Kingdom of Denmark  (consisting of Denmark  Greenland and the Faroe  Islands)  Finland  Iceland  Norway and Sweden. These  close relationships are underpinned by shared values   a common outlook on the world and a shared commit- ment to ensuring a peaceful and stable Arctic through  the enduring success of NATO. They continue to grow  stronger  with a particularly marked increase in dialogue  and cooperation since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now  more than ever  it is critical for Canada to have strong  partnerships with the Nordic states  as Canada and they  are all now members of NATO and Russia’s actions have  complicated cooperation in multilateral spaces of Arctic  governance. Examples of Canada’s close relationships  with its Nordic Arctic neighbours include the following:    In 2022  Canada was the first country to ratify    the accessions of Finland and Sweden to NATO.    In June 2023  Canada’s prime minister was the  invited guest at the Nordic prime ministers’   annual meeting  in Iceland.    In June 2024  the Government of Canada committed  up to $20 million in funding for an international  research initiative on the sustainable development  of the Arctic in collaboration with NordForsk  an   organization under the Nordic Council of Ministers.  It will support collaborative and multi-disciplinary  scientific efforts and contributions from across the  Arctic region and include Indigenous perspectives.    In September 2024  Canada’s minister of foreign affairs  and the premier of Nunavut co-hosted representa- tives from the Kingdom of Denmark  Finland  Iceland   Norway and Sweden for the first Canada-Nordic  Strategic Dialogue  in Iqaluit  Nunavut.    Canada is committed to deepening its partnership  with the Nordic countries as friends and allies with  common values and shared stewardship over the Arctic.  Strengthening Canada’s cooperation will also help it  respond to new threats and below-threshold activities by  its adversaries in both the North American Arctic and the  European High North.   Working in collaboration with other  federal departments  we will increase  our support for bilateral and regional  cooperation with the Kingdom of  Denmark  Finland  Iceland  Norway  and Sweden in Arctic science and  technology  climate change  culture   Indigenous-to-Indigenous ties  natural  resources  sustainable development  through trade and infrastructure and  defence and security.  We will also create a new position  in one of Canada’s Nordic missions  with responsibility for increasing  coordination and information sharing   including on security issues    with Nordic partners.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  27  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy To do this  we will open new consulates in Anchorage   Alaska  and Nuuk  Greenland.  Alaska is a key partner on a range of issues  including  border security and crossings  security and defence in  the Arctic  climate resilience and conservation  energy  security  critical minerals and Indigenous affairs.   Members of the CAF are stationed in Alaska to support  the NORAD mission and work alongside their U.S. military  counterparts in the defence of North America.  In addition  the Yukon also has mature and close-knit  bilateral relations with Alaska from both a political and  trade perspective.   iii. The North American Arctic: Alaska and Greenland  The North American Arctic encompasses the vast   northern territories of 3 countries: Alaska (the United  States) in the west; northern Canada in the centre;   and Greenland (the Kingdom of Denmark) in the east.   The relationships in this region are unique due to   geographical proximity and the ancestral relations   that exist between Indigenous Peoples  which give rise   to a number of shared interests  including on security   defence  climate change  sustainable development   critical minerals  trade  culture and Indigenous mobility.  The ANPF emphasizes increasing cooperation among  federal  territorial  provincial and Indigenous govern- ments and other organizations in and across the   Canadian Arctic and with Canada’s North American   Arctic partners.  The Arctic Foreign Policy complements this by  re-emphasizing the importance of deepening Canada’s  diplomatic engagement with its neighbours  the United  States  including Alaska  and the Kingdom of Denmark   including Greenland. This will make the Canadian and  North American Arctic more secure and create new  opportunities for economic cooperation  scientific   collaboration and cultural exchange.   The consulate in Anchorage will help promote trade and  economic ties between Canada’s territories and provinces and  Alaska; improve security and defence partnerships; strengthen  collaboration on environmental and wildlife issues; engage with  Alaskan communities  including Indigenous communities; and  support cross-border people-to-people ties.   28  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Many ties  both formal and informal  have been forged  over the years at all levels of government and between  Inuit organizations in Canada and Greenland. Several  bilateral initiatives have been advanced in recent years   including the Letter of Intent for Cooperation on the  Pikialasorsuaq (2023) and the Memorandum of Under- standing between the Government of Greenland and the  Government of Nunavut (2022). However  cooperation to  date has largely occurred organically  without an   overarching foreign policy framework.  In recognition of the growing importance of Greenland   as a key Arctic partner  a more coordinated approach  with Greenland  including with the government of   Nunavut  is a priority in ensuring that Canadian   interests are being advanced effectively.  The consulate in Nuuk will be a  valuable resource for coordinating  and advancing Canadian interests in  Greenland  enhancing bilateral and  commercial relations  facilitating  research collaboration and supporting  increased engagement and  collaboration across many   policy spaces.  We welcome Greenland’s  commitment to open a  representational office in Canada.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  29  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Holding    Russia    accountable  Russia represents a generational geopolitical challenge.  Although Russia accounts for 50% of the Arctic   geographically  bilateral cooperation between Canada  and Russia  including in the Arctic  will remain   exceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future.  Canada will continue to hold Russia accountable in regional  and multilateral forums for its actions and counter disinformation  promoted by the Russian regime  including through Canada’s  leadership of the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism. This includes  countering disinformation targeting communities   in the Canadian Arctic.   Alongside allies and partners  Canada will continue confronting  Russian aggression  including through Canada’s enduring   support for Ukraine  and by continuing to meet NATO   defence commitments.  Together with the United States  Canada will defend NATO’s  western flank  and with Arctic allies  Canada will defend NATO’s  northern regions and approaches.  Canada acknowledges that the actions of the Putin  regime do not always reflect the values of the Russian  people. This policy clearly differentiates between   government actions and those of the broader Russian  population  including its Indigenous Peoples  who them- selves have been marginalized by the Russian regime.  Across all multilateral bodies  Canada will maintain its  policy of limited engagement with Russian officials.  It is for Russia to create the conditions that will enable  a return to political engagement and cooperation by  ending its war in Ukraine and acting in accordance   with international law.  30  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   3.  Pragmatic    diplomacy    with non-    Arctic states    and actors  While Canada will continue to prioritize cooperation   with Arctic states  especially when it comes to setting  the rules that govern the region  cooperation with a  wider set of actors is beneficial and necessary to address  challenges to the Arctic emanating from global issues   such as climate change.  Given the prospect of growing competition in the Arctic   Canada will be strategic in prioritizing pragmatic   cooperation with non-Arctic states and actors that   align with Canadian values  interests and objectives.  Canada will be guided by the following principles:   › Respect for Arctic states’ sovereignty  sovereign rights and    jurisdiction in the Arctic.   › Support for the rules-based international order in the Arctic    and a demonstrated commitment to regional peace and stability.   › Respect for Indigenous self-determination  Indigenous rights and the values    interests  cultures and traditions of Arctic Indigenous Peoples  including the   participation of Indigenous Peoples in Arctic decision making  and other   Arctic inhabitants.   › Respect for the extensive legal framework that applies to the Arctic Ocean     including UNCLOS.   › Recognition of interests and expertise that are relevant to  and aligned with     Canada’s Arctic and northern priorities  as well as its national defence   and security interests.   › Maintaining a commitment to uphold and advance democratic values    human rights and gender equality according to international standards    regulations and principles.   › Openness with regard to scientific data sharing and collaboration   with Canadian researchers and local communities  including their   representative governments.   › Commitment to sustainable development  conservation  environmental    protection and fighting climate change.   Engagement with non-Arctic states and actors will be  channeled through a variety of multilateral forums  such  as the Arctic Council  appropriate UN bodies  NATO and  the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable  as well as treaties  that apply to the Arctic  such as the Central Arctic Ocean  Fisheries Agreement  and bilateral and multilateral   platforms and projects that we will drive with other  federal departments and agencies.  Going forward  based on the above principles  Canada  will place particular emphasis on cooperation with  non-Arctic states and actors in 2 regions: the North  Atlantic and the North Pacific.  31  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy The North Atlantic  Canada will strengthen engagement  on Arctic matters with the European  Union  the United Kingdom and other  key North Atlantic states through  established mechanisms  such as the  Canada–European Union Strategic  Partnership Agreement. Science   technology and innovation will remain  the focus of Canada’s cooperation with  the European Union and key European  states through Canada’s engagement  on the European Union–United  States–Canada Arctic Working Group  of the All-Atlantic Ocean Research  and Innovation Alliance; the Canada- European Union Ocean Partnership  Forum; and the Horizon   Europe program.  Other priorities for Arctic cooperation include facilitating  the mobility of Inuit between Canada and Greenland;  facilitating the trade of  and access to  the seal products  of Inuit and other Indigenous Peoples  in the E.U. market;  the conservation of fish stocks through the Canada– European Union High-Level Dialogue on Fisheries;   environmental protection; climate mitigation and   adaptation; trade and sustainable economic   development; security cooperation through   high-level dialogues; and the Canada–European   Union Green Alliance.  The United Kingdom is another close partner in the  North Atlantic based on Canada’s deep partnership   with the country and their historic ties and shared values.  The 2 countries enjoy a close-knit defence partnership   and they cooperate on shared priorities in the Arctic   including on climate change and research through   the Canada–Inuit Nunangat–United Kingdom Arctic   Research Programme.    Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  32  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy The\\tNorth\\tPacific  Canada’s Indo-Pacific Strategy recognizes that several  Indo-Pacific states are looking to the Arctic as a region  of opportunity and as a means through which to engage  with Canada.  The strategy recognizes the North Pacific as part of  Canada’s neighbourhood. The North Pacific  through  the Bering Strait  is one of the key approaches to the  North American Arctic. Canada must not undervalue the  strategic importance of these approaches—Canada’s  adversaries do not underestimate them. In line with the  strategy  Canada will explore ways to deepen Arctic  cooperation with key North Pacific states on issues of  mutual interest while also responding to the emerging  challenges some may represent.  While Canada is pleased to engage with Indo-Pacific  states making positive contributions in the Arctic accord- ing to the principles for engagement with non-Arctic  states  Canada will closely scrutinize activities of states  whose ambitions or activities are potentially counter to  Canadian values  interests or objectives in the region.  In addition to Canada’s long-standing partnership with the  United States on Arctic issues  focus will be given to increasing  cooperation with other key partners in the region—Japan and the  Republic of Korea—given the mutual long-standing relationships  and shared values of the 3 nations.  Canada will work through established forums and mechanisms   such as the Arctic Council  the Canada-Japan Action Plan for  Contributing to a Free and Open Indo-Pacific Region and the  Canada-Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership  to identify  concrete opportunities to deepen cooperation between the   4 countries on shared priorities  such as maritime security   science and technology  trade and sustainable economic   development and fisheries.  33  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Leadership on Arctic governance  and multilateral challenges  Despite\\texceedingly\\tdifficult\\trelations\\twith\\tRussia \\tArctic\\tstates\\t  continue to preside over a well-governed region operating under   extensive national and international legal frameworks.

Reinforcing      the Arctic    Council  Canada is firmly committed to the enduring value of the  Arctic Council and is adhering to its established Rules  of Procedure. Canada remains focused on continuing  the council’s important work for the benefit of the Arctic  region and the people living there  including   Indigenous Peoples.    Since 2021  our Global Arctic Leadership Initiative has  funded the establishment of a permanent secretariat  of the Arctic Council’s Sustainable Development   Working Group in Canada and provided over $2 million  in funding for more than 25 Arctic Council initiatives  with national  civil society and Indigenous partners.   The Arctic Council exists thanks in part to Canadian and  Indigenous leadership. Canada will not allow Russia’s  actions to undermine the integrity or functionality of this  important body. The people of the Arctic  who benefit so  deeply from the important work of the council  should  not be made to suffer because of Russia’s choices.     We will increase our contributions to the Arctic Council to allow for more Canadian  engagement and leadership in council projects and greater institutional support for the  council  as well as provide funding for innovative Indigenous and youth ideas in the council.  This support is critically important as the council continues to increase its activities.  Canada will increase its leadership in the council in preparation for Canada’s third chairship  of the Arctic Council  from 2029 to 2031. Working with Canadian and Arctic Council  partners  Canada will meaningfully engage the Permanent Participants from Canada   territorial and provincial governments of Canada and other Indigenous partners on the  planning and development of Canada’s Arctic Council chairship program.   Those essential building blocks will also provide guidance on how Canada engages in  other international polar processes  such as the International Polar Year: 2032 to 2033  which  is an opportunity to showcase Canada’s leadership through scientific and technological  achievements  as well as by amplifying Indigenous Peoples’ voices and   their rich knowledge.  35  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Addressing regional     and global challenges  i.  Climate change and environmental protection  While the triple crisis of climate change  biodiversity   loss and pollution is a global problem that requires  urgent collective action  the impacts of this triple crisis  are disproportionately felt by northerners. Canada has  taken a dual-track approach to addressing these issues   with engagement at the multilateral level through the  UN system and at the regional level through   the Arctic Council.  In addition to robust domestic measures to address  climate change  Canada is also working with international  partners to boost global efforts to achieve the Paris  Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C to avoid   the most devastating impacts for the world    including the Arctic.  Cutting emissions of black carbon is the most powerful  action to take to slow the pace of near-term warming in  the Arctic. For this reason  Arctic states agreed to   collectively reduce emissions of black carbon by 25%   to 33% of 2013 levels by 2025. Canada is on track to do   its part in achieving this collective goal.  Canada is also doing its part to address biodiversity loss  and advance conservation domestically and globally.  Canada continues to work toward conserving 30%   of its lands and oceans by 2030. A large part of   Canada’s protected and conserved areas fall within   Canada’s Arctic and North  and many are being   co-managed with Indigenous Peoples.6   To increase cohesiveness  we will continue to leverage  our diplomatic resources in support of all government  efforts led by Environment and Climate Change  Canada in the UN system to ensure implementation  of the historic Paris Agreement  of the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change  and of the  Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework  under the Convention on Biological Diversity.   Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  6 Final Report of the National Advisory Panel on Marine Protected Area Standards   36  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Canada’s ambassador for climate change will continue to advocate for international  partners to join Canada-led initiatives on phasing out coal; reducing short-lived climate  pollutants; finalizing a global treaty to end plastic pollution; protecting more of nature; and  other related initiatives. The ambassador will also continue to promote any other diplomatic  initiatives that address climate change. The Arctic ambassador will support this work.  Additionally  in the context of the Arctic Council’s initiatives on climate change  Canada will  continue its ongoing work at a regional level to develop scientific assessments on the  impacts of climate change and the state of biodiversity in the Arctic; to reduce short-lived  climate pollutants in the Arctic region; to encourage the use and development of renewable  energy in remote Arctic communities to exchange knowledge and implement solutions  on wildfires and climate change adaptation in an Arctic context; to develop a pan-Arctic  network of marine protected areas; and to implement the regional action plan on marine  litter in the Arctic.  Elsewhere  we will encourage all allies to join NATO’s Climate Change and Security  Centre of Excellence  which is based in Montréal. Working with the Department of  National Defence  we will also leverage the centre’s expertise to promote research and  knowledge sharing on climate security threats in the Arctic and elsewhere.

This  imposes a responsibility on Canada to ensure that the  area is well managed. Canada is collaborating closely  with fellow Arctic Ocean coastal states and other   interested parties to implement the Central Arctic Ocean  Fisheries Agreement  which established a precautionary  16-year ban on commercial fishing on the high seas of  the Arctic Ocean  as well as a program for joint scientific  research and monitoring that includes Indigenous  Knowledge as a vital component to ensure that the best  available knowledge is used in decision making. Canada  is also ensuring that Inuit in Canada continue to be part  of this process.  Canada is also prioritizing the protection of the marine  environment in the Arctic Ocean in cooperation with  its like-minded international and Indigenous partners.  Canada maintains an indefinite moratorium on offshore  oil and gas development in its Arctic waters. Canada  also supports  in the absence of both a comprehensive  understanding of seabed mining’s environmental  impacts and a robust regulatory regime  a moratorium  on commercial seabed mining in areas beyond national  jurisdiction  including in the central Arctic Ocean.  Canada is committed to reinforcing rules-based  approaches in the Arctic Ocean.  We will work with other departments and agencies   to continue to develop and implement international  measures to promote safe and responsible shipping  in the Arctic  including by supporting efforts at the IMO  and the Arctic Council that complement the International  Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (known as the  “Polar Code”) and the ban on heavy fuel oil   in Arctic waters.    Across all areas of Canada’s multilateral cooperation   in the UN system  at the Arctic Council and under   the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement  it is   imperative that Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples  be meaningfully engaged in discussions when their  rights or interests could be potentially impacted.  We will continue to provide funding  to Indigenous Permanent Participant  organizations in Canada to engage  in this work. We will also advocate   alongside Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples  for the equal  treatment and inclusion of Indigenous  Knowledge and science.  In support of Fisheries and Oceans  Canada  we undertake to advocate  for the development of marine  protected areas and other effective  conservation measures in the central  Arctic Ocean under the Arctic Council   thereby enabling Arctic states to lead  by example in implementing the  UN agreement on marine biological  diversity in areas beyond   national jurisdiction.  38  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Adopting a more inclusive  approach to Arctic diplomacy  1.\\tEnsuring\\tArctic\\tdiplomacy\\tis\\tinformed\\tby\\tand\\tbenefits\\tArctic\\t   and northern Indigenous Peoples and other northerners   The Arctic is home to more than 4 million people   including Indigenous Peoples who have inhabited the  region for thousands of years. Canada is committed to  a more inclusive approach to this foreign policy that  ensures people living in the North  including Indigenous  peoples  can participate in international decision making  on matters that affect their rights or interests.  Arctic diplomacy should be informed by and benefit  Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples and other  northerners. We remain committed to this goal and  will strengthen our efforts in this area  building on the  approach adopted in the ANPF to remain open to  holding discussions within more appropriate   distinctions-based frameworks  like the Inuit-Crown   Partnership Committee.   To move forward  Canada acknowledges the damaging  impacts of colonialism on the Indigenous Peoples   of Canada’s Arctic and North. Grounded in a commitment  to reconciliation  this policy seeks to build in the Arctic  foreign policy space a renewed Inuit-Crown and   nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous Peoples  based on the recognition of rights  respect  cooperation   and partnership.  Our work on this foreign policy will be guided by the  United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous  Peoples; treaties  including land claims agreements;  self-government agreements with Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples; and the Inuit Nunangat Policy.7  Canada’s Arctic foreign policy will also be guided  by respect for territorial and provincial jurisdiction   including the devolution agreements with the Northwest  Territories  Nunavut and the Yukon.  7\\t The\\tInuit\\tNunangat\\tPolicy\\trecognizes\\tInuit\\tNunangat\\tas\\ta\\tdistinct\\tgeographic \\tcultural\\tand\\tpolitical\\tregion\\tthat\\tforms\\t40%\\tof\\tCanada’s\\tland\\tarea \\t  \\t nearly\\tthree-quarters\\tof\\tits\\tcoastline\\tand\\tsignificant\\toffshore\\tareas.\\tIt\\talso\\tacknowledges\\tInuit\\tTreaty\\tOrganizations’\\tright\\tto\\trepresent\\tthemselves\\tnationally\\t  \\t and\\tinternationally\\tand\\tthat\\tstructurally\\tthey\\tmay\\tchoose\\tInuit\\tTapiriit\\tKanatami\\tand\\tthe\\tInuit\\tCircumpolar\\tCouncil\\tto\\trepresent\\tInuit\\tat\\tthe\\tnational\\t  \\t and\\tinternational\\tlevels\\trespectively.  39  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy i.  Arctic ambassador  The geopolitical landscape in the Arctic has become increasingly complex  and competitive. To ensure that the Canadian Arctic remains a region that  is stable  prosperous and secure  we need to deepen our engagement with  like-minded states  as well as with territorial and provincial governments   Indigenous Peoples and other domestic partners.  To lead this effort  we will establish the position of Arctic ambassador.  The ambassador’s responsibilities will include making linkages between domestic issues  and those relating to Canada’s foreign affairs; serving as Canada’s Senior Arctic Official and  advancing Canada’s polar interests in multilateral forums; engaging with counterparts in  Arctic and non-Arctic states  as well as with Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic; and raising  awareness internationally of Indigenous rights in the Arctic context. The ambassador will  also support the work of Global Affairs Canada and other departments on Arctic research  security.  In carrying out these duties  the ambassador will work closely with Arctic and  northern Indigenous Peoples  territorial and provincial governments and other northerners.   The ambassador will serve as a representative in our diplomatic corps and distinguish  himself or herself by ensuring that the Arctic Foreign Policy remains connected to the reality  of Canadians living in the Arctic. The ambassador will also play an important role in Canada’s  broader efforts toward reconciliation. The ambassador will have an office in Canada’s North.

Northern and Indigenous diplomacy      on the world stage  Canada remains committed to providing international  platforms for northerners  including territorial  provincial  and Indigenous partners and youths  to engage in and to  represent their own international Arctic views  especially  on issues that impact their rights or jurisdiction. Canada  also welcomes made-in-the-North initiatives to support  homegrown policy development that enhances northern  and Indigenous diplomacy on the world stage.    a. Sub-national governments  Arctic and northern public governments play a strategic  role in Canada’s Arctic diplomacy efforts. Canada  remains committed to including territorial government  officials in the Canadian delegation to Arctic   Council meetings.     b.  Arctic and northern Indigenous diplomacy  The Arctic Foreign Policy recommits to enhancing the  representation and participation of Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples in relevant negotiations and  international forums  such as the Arctic Council and the  United Nations  including the UN Permanent Forum on  Indigenous Issues  and all other bodies that Arctic and  northern Indigenous Peoples judge to affect them.  We have heard clearly from Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners that they are looking for more than  a platform where they are only one voice consulted  among many. Instead  Indigenous partners require and  demand meaningful continuous engagement to actively  partake in and shape decision making at the international  level that reflects their roles as rights holders. We will   uphold the role of Arctic and northern Indigenous   Peoples as active partners in the conduct of interna- tional relations in the Arctic and support their efforts   to advance this goal.  The Arctic Athabaskan Council  Gwich’in Council   International and the Inuit Circumpolar Council currently  sit at the Arctic Council as Permanent Participants   with membership from Canada.  Since 2020  Canada has increased funding to the   3 Permanent Participants in Canada  allowing each of  them to receive up to $650 000 each year. This support  is strengthening Indigenous voices in international Arctic  matters  particularly at the Arctic Council.  With Transport Canada  we will  support opportunities for the Inuit  Circumpolar Council Canada to  represent Inuit Knowledge and  perspectives in international forums   including on Arctic shipping and  environmental matters at the IMO.  Canada will also support similar efforts by other Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples to increase their  representation at relevant international forums to  ensure their rights and perspectives inform decision  making at the global level. Canada will work with   Indigenous partners to identify possible ways of   improving the capacity and role of Indigenous Peoples   in international Arctic affairs.   Canada remains strongly committed to the ANPF’s  objective of providing Arctic and northern youths with  additional opportunities to participate in  and benefit  from  Canada’s international Arctic agenda. We have  leveraged support for UArctic (an international network  of universities  colleges  research institutes and other  organizations concerned with education and research in  and about the Arctic) to provide opportunities for Canadi- ans to study in different parts of the circumpolar Arctic  to  generate regional solutions and to support collaboration  in Indigenous research and education.  41  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Photos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  iii. Northern and Indigenous representation      at Global Affairs Canada  Indigenous Peoples and northerners are   underrepresented at Global Affairs Canada  and   sustained efforts are needed to boost recruitment   and retention.  In line with the Future of Diplomacy  the department is  developing a new external recruitment strategy that will  be launched in 2025. The strategy will support outreach  across Canada to identify Canadians with the skills   needed to deliver on our various mandates and will  include specific outreach to under-represented   communities  including among Indigenous Peoples   and northerners.  To support our recruitment efforts and  increase Indigenous perspectives in the  department  we will establish a paid  Arctic and northern Indigenous youth  internship program that will consider  the need of Arctic and northern  Indigenous youths to remain close   to their families and communities   and ensure that appropriate support   is in place.  We will also work with partners to  identify other avenues for increasing  the representation of Indigenous  Peoples and northerners at Global  Affairs Canada.   42  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Advancing Indigenous    and northern foreign    policy priorities  Broadening Canada’s international engagement to   contribute more directly to domestic issues  such as  closing socio-economic gaps  supporting infrastructure  development  enhancing knowledge of the North    protecting the Arctic environment and advancing   reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples  remains a priority.  Key issues include those described below.  i.  Cross-border mobility  First Nations  Inuit and Métis communities in Canada’s  Arctic and North share long-standing spiritual  cultural   political  economic  social and family connections with  Indigenous communities in the United States and Green- land. The introduction of modern international borders  and the associated controls on cross-border mobility  have negatively impacted Indigenous Peoples’ ability  to maintain familial  economic and cultural ties and  traditional practices.  Photos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  Canada has been working with  Indigenous partners and the United  States  Denmark and Greenland to find  solutions to address border crossing  and migration challenges faced by First  Nations  Inuit and Métis Peoples.   This commitment is reflected in Action  Plan Measure Shared Priorities 52 of the  Action Plan to implement the United  Nations Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples Act.   To address border mobility challenges  faced by First Nations  Inuit and Métis  Peoples who live in the United States   including Alaska  Canada intends  to bring forward legislation and  regulatory measures.  43  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii.   Market access  Indigenous Peoples also face unjustifiable barriers to  trade—barriers that also restrict international market  access to Indigenous-harvested and -produced goods   such as seal fur and ivory products.  The traditional harvesting of seals and other species by  Inuit and other Indigenous Peoples of Canada is both  a sustainable and a valuable contributor to Arctic and  northern communities. Trade barriers by key partners   such as the United States  the European Union and other  countries  have a broad detrimental impact on life in  Canada’s remote Arctic and northern communities.  In August 2024  Canada submitted  a response to the European  Commission’s review of its regulation  on the trade of seal products. Canada  requested that the European Union  repeal its regulations and replace  them with rules that offer access   to ethically and sustainably   harvested products.  Canada will continue to advocate  for a repeal of the seal product ban.  We will also promote awareness of  sustainable seal products and harvest  management by hosting officials-level  dialogues with Arctic countries and  Indigenous partners at our missions   to the European Union and the   United States.

Indigenous Knowledge and participation  Canada supports Indigenous advocacy against pervasive  colonial approaches to Arctic science and research   which marginalize and discredit Indigenous Knowledge  and participation.  iv. Indigenous languages  Indigenous languages such as Inuktut8 are essential to  the preservation of Indigenous culture and the well-  being of Indigenous Peoples and communities. Canada  will therefore enhance its efforts to work with its Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners to facilitate the  exchange of knowledge and best practices related   to Indigenous language assessment  monitoring   and revitalization.  We will continue to support  equitable research partnerships  at the international level between  Indigenous and non-Indigenous  researchers  such as the Canada–Inuit  Nunangat–United Kingdom Arctic  Research Programme.  Looking forward  we will continue  to contribute to federal efforts on  a broader range of northern and  Indigenous priorities  and we will  collaborate with Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners  territorial  and provincial governments and  other northerners on international  advocacy as appropriate. This includes  promoting investment in critical  minerals development; transportation;  energy and electrification; broadband  connectivity; cultural diplomacy; and  the conservation of the Porcupine  caribou herd. We will also work with  Indigenous partners  Canadian Heritage  and other relevant government  departments to advocate for the  repatriation from across the globe of  artifacts originating from First Nations   Inuit and Métis communities.  8\\t Inuktut\\tis\\tthe\\tfirst\\tlanguage\\tused\\tin\\tInuit\\tNunaat \\tand\\tthe\\tmajority\\tof\\tInuit\\tNunaat\\tresidents\\tcontinue\\tto\\tspeak\\tInuktut\\tas\\ttheir\\tfirst \\tonly\\tor\\tpreferred\\tlanguage.\\t  \\t Therefore \\tto\\tuphold\\tthe\\tinherent\\tdignity\\tof\\tInuit \\tsupporting\\tInuktut\\tin\\tthis\\tcontext\\tas\\ta\\tfirst\\tor\\tlater\\tlanguage\\taligns\\twith\\tthe\\tbroader\\tpurposes\\tof \\tamong\\t  \\t other\\tthings \\tworking\\tin\\tpartnership\\tto\\tdemonstrate\\tand\\tpromote\\tshared\\trespect\\tfor\\tthe\\thistory\\tand\\timportance\\tof\\tInuktut\\tand\\tfor\\tsocio-economic\\t  \\t and\\tcultural\\tdevelopment.  45  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy v.   Supporting northern and Indigenous      trade and export  In line with Canada’s inclusive approach to trade and   its Export Diversification Strategy  we are committed   to supporting northern and Indigenous exporters in   accessing global markets.  The Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) recognizes that  building strong relationships with our northern and  Indigenous partners is key to this mission. Dedicated  trade commissioners  based in regional offices for British  Columbia and the Yukon; Alberta and the Northwest   Territories; Quebec and Nunavut; Manitoba and  Saskatchewan; and Atlantic Canada  work closely with  Canadian businesses in the Arctic and northern regions  to support their global expansion. The TCS network  also continues to actively support and develop tailored  programming for northern and Indigenous exporters   including through business delegations and export  training and accelerator programs  among other ways.  Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) into northern  and Indigenous communities will also play a vital role in  economic and infrastructure development in the region.  Through our increasing engagement with Northern and  Indigenous communities via the CanExport Community  Investments program  we will continue to support  municipalities and economic development organizations  in seeking and retaining FDI in the North while ensuring  that Canada’s environmental and national security   interests are protected.    3.  Transforming Global    \\tAffairs\\tCanada’s\\tdomestic\\t   engagement processes  We are committed to pursuing an ongoing collaborative  approach to domestic engagement that is informed by  early  sustained and meaningful engagement with   territorial and provincial governments  Arctic and   northern Indigenous governments and organizations   and northerners more generally.  46  The Arctic Cooperation Advisory  Committee is a Canadian forum  for the engagement of relevant  federal departments  territorial  and provincial governments and  Permanent Participant partners on the  development and implementation of  Canada’s international Arctic policy   including Arctic-Council-related  matters. It will remain an important  mechanism for dialogue and  engagement on the development and  implementation of Canada’s Arctic  Foreign Policy.   We are committed to exploring  distinctions-based engagements with  First Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty  and Self-Governing Partners from  Canada’s Arctic and North.  For example  we are committed to  engaging directly with Inuit through the  Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee as  we apply the Inuit Nunangat Policy to  our programs  policies and services.  In addition  we will expand  opportunities for territorial and  provincial governments and Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners to  join or support Canadian delegations  at bilateral or international Arctic  meetings and treaty negotiations if  in  such meetings and negotiations  their  rights or interests could potentially   be impacted.   We will also continue to provide a  critical coordination function for  multi-stakeholder Arctic events to  support a strong Canadian presence.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy CONCLUSION  The Arctic is a region of tremendous opportunity thanks  to its plentiful resources and resilient people.   However  Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine  rapidly   advancing climate change and increasing interest in  the Arctic from non-Arctic states has led to increased  competition and geopolitical tension in the region.   To ensure that the Arctic remains stable  prosperous and  secure and to fully implement the objectives laid out  in the International chapter of the ANPF  Canada needs  a diplomatic strategy that responds to this evolving  geopolitical context.  The Arctic Foreign Policy reorients Canada’s approach  to the Arctic based on a clear-eyed assessment of the  threats Canada faces today  and those it anticipates in  the future. It aligns Canada’s foreign and defence policy  to ensure the security of Canadians and ensures that  together with its allies  Canada can guard against and  defend itself against threats from its adversaries   in the Arctic.  By reinforcing the pillars of Arctic governance and the  principles of the rules-based international order  this  policy will help to safeguard the collective interests   of the peoples of the Arctic from those who would   seek to impose their wills.   This policy will strengthen our relationships with   territorial and provincial governments  Arctic and   northern Indigenous governments and organizations   and other northerners. It will produce new and more  effective ways of working together on Arctic diplomacy  that will transform Canada’s approach   to international engagement.  Canadian diplomacy has a role to play in building  renewed relationships with First Nations  Inuit  Métis   Modern Treaty and Self-Governing Partners; relationships  that are based on the recognition of rights  respect   and partnership.  The Arctic Foreign Policy is built on a vision of shared  cooperation and prosperity for all the peoples of the  Arctic who are committed to peace and stability.   Together  we can realize this future and ensure Canada’s  place as a leader in the Arctic for generations to come.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  47  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Annex: Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   development process and Canada’s Arctic   and\\tNorthern\\tPolicy\\tFramework\\t(ANPF) \\t  published in 2019  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   development process  In the spirit of the principle of “nothing about us without  us ” the Arctic Foreign Policy was developed on the basis  of extensive and distinctions-based engagement and  on collaboration and cooperation with domestic rights  holders from Canada’s Arctic and North  including First  Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-Governing  Partners and organizations; the territorial governments  (the Northwest Territories  Nunavut and the Yukon);  and provincial governments (Manitoba  Newfoundland  and Labrador and Quebec). We engaged partners in a  variety of formats  including bilateral meetings  regional  round-table discussions and ANPF   governance mechanisms.  The Arctic Foreign Policy is guided by all relevant  treaties and self-government agreements with Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners  including obligations  Canada has to Indigenous Peoples under those treaties  and agreements  and the rights recognized and affirmed  under section 35 of the Constitution Act  1982. It is further  guided by the Yukon Northern Affairs Program   Devolution Transfer Agreement (2003)  the Northwest  Territories Devolution Agreement (2014)  the United  Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  (endorsed by Canada in 2020)  the Inuit Nunangat Policy  (2022) and the Nunavut Lands and Resources Devolution   Agreement (2024).  The policy development process was also informed by  engagement with like-minded Arctic states; specifically   the Kingdom of Denmark  Finland  Iceland  Norway   Sweden and the United States.    48  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   Canada’s ANPF  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy complements and  supports the implementation of the ANPF  which was  published in 2019. The ANPF was co-developed with  over 25 First Nations  Inuit and Métis governments and  organizations  as well as with territorial and   provincial governments.   The ANPF sets out a common vision of a future where  Arctic and northern peoples are thriving  strong and  safe. The framework includes a co-developed policy  statement and the whole-of-government International  chapter  which articulates Canada’s goals and objectives  for the circumpolar Arctic in 3 key areas that   remain in effect:  1. Strengthening the rules-based   international order in the Arctic   2. More clearly defining Canada’s    Arctic boundaries   3. Broadening Canada’s international    engagement to contribute to the priorities   of the Canadian Arctic   The implementation of the International chapter has  been supported by Global Affairs Canada’s Global   Arctic Leadership Initiative with an annual budget   of $7 million each year to strengthen Canada’s global   leadership in the Arctic.  The ANPF’s Safety  security and defence chapter also  underlines the importance of strengthening cooperation  with international partners on safety  security   and defence issues.  Canada remains committed to strengthening Arctic   and northern infrastructure and to closing infrastructure  gaps with other regions of Canada to forge opportunities   for economic development  to address reconciliation    to increase resilience and to contribute to Arctic defence  and security.

Federal institutions should explore potential uses of generative AI tools for supporting and improving their operations. However  because these tools are evolving  they should not be used in all cases. Federal institutions must be cautious and evaluate the risks before they start using them. The use of these tools should be restricted to instances where risks can be effectively managed.  1 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     This document provides preliminary guidance to federal institutions on their use of generative AI tools. This includes instances where these tools are deployed by federal institutions. It provides an overview of generative AI  identifies challenges and concerns relating to its use  puts forward principles for using it responsibly  and offers policy considerations and best practices.  This guide also seeks to raise awareness and foster coordination among federal institutions. It highlights the importance of engaging key stakeholders before deploying generative AI tools for public use and before using them for purposes such as service delivery. These stakeholders include legal counsel  privacy and security experts  and the Office of the Chief Information Officer at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS).  The guide complements and supports compliance with many existing federal laws and policies  including in areas of privacy  security  intellectual property  and human rights. The guide is intended to be evergreen as TBS recognizes the need for iteration to keep pace with regulatory and technological change.  What is generative AI  The Directive on Automated Decision-Making defines AI as information technology that performs tasks that would ordinarily require biological brainpower to accomplish  such as making sense of spoken language  learning behaviours  or solving problems.  Generative AI is a type of AI that produces content such as text  audio  code  videos and images.  information that the user inputs  which consists of prompts (typically  1  This content is produced based on  2 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     short instructional texts).  Examples of generative AI tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT and Bing Chat; GitHub Copilot  which produces code based on text prompts; and DALL-E  Midjourney and Stable Diffusion  which produce images from text or image prompts. In addition  generative AI models can be fine-tuned  or custom models can be trained and deployed to meet an organization’s needs.   2  3  Many generative AI models have been trained on large volumes of data  including publicly available data from the Internet. Based on the training data  these models generate content that is statistically likely in response  for example  by predicting the next word in a sentence. to a prompt   Techniques such as human supervision and reinforcement learning can also be applied to further improve the outputs    and users can provide feedback or change their prompt to refine the response. Generative AI can therefore produce content that looks as though a human produced it.  3  Generative AI can be used to perform or support various tasks including:   writing and editing documents and emails  coding tasks  such as debugging and generating templates and  common solutions   summarizing information  brainstorming  research  translation and learning  providing support to clients (for example  answering questions   troubleshooting)  Challenges and concerns  3 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     Before federal institutions start using generative AI tools  they must assess and mitigate certain ethical  legal and other risks. For example  these tools can generate inaccurate content; amplify biases; and violate intellectual property  privacy and other laws. Further  some tools may not meet federal privacy and security requirements. When institutions use these tools  they must protect personal information and sensitive data. As well  because these tools generate content that can look as though a human produced it  people might not be able to tell whether they are interacting with a person or a tool. The use of these tools can also affect the skill and judgment of public servants and can have environmental costs.  Generative AI tools rely on models that pose various challenges  including limited transparency and explainability. They also rely on training data that is difficult to access and assess. These challenges stem in part from large model sizes  high volumes of training data  and the proprietary nature of many of the tools. In addition  the outputs of the models are constrained by the prompts and the training data  which may lack context that is not publicly available on the Internet. Training data could also be outdated; for example  ChatGPT is trained on data up to 2021  so it has a limited ability to provide information on events after that.  certain purposes; for example  they tend to perform poorly on tasks related to emotion.    As well  these tools have limitations that reduce their utility for  4 5  6 7  Generative AI could also pose risks to the integrity and security of federal institutions  given its potential misuse by threat actors. Federal institutions should be aware of these risks and ensure that the necessary mitigation measures are in place in accordance with the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security’s guidance on generative AI.  4 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     Recommended approach Federal institutions should explore how they could use generative AI tools to support their operations and improve outcomes for Canadians. However  given the challenges and concerns relating to these tools  institutions should assess and mitigate risks and should restrict their use to activities where they can manage the risks effectively. Given the growing adoption of these technologies in different sectors and by the public  their use in government will help keep pace with the evolving digital landscape.  Federal institutions should evaluate the tools for their potential to help employees  not replace them. When deciding whether to use generative AI tools  public servants should refer to the guide to ethical decision- making in section 6 of Values Alive: A Discussion Guide to the “Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector.”  To maintain public trust and ensure the responsible use of generative AI tools  federal institutions should align with the “FASTER” principles:   Fair: ensure that content from these tools does not include or  amplify biases and that it complies with human rights  accessibility  and procedural and substantive fairness obligations   Accountable: take responsibility for the content generated by these  tools. This includes making sure it is factual  legal  ethical  and compliant with the terms of use   Secure: ensure that the infrastructure and tools are appropriate for  the security classification of the information and that privacy and personal information are protected   Transparent: identify content that has been produced using  generative AI; notify users that they are interacting with an AI tool;  5 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     document decisions and be able to provide explanations if tools are used to support decision-making   Educated: learn about the strengths  limitations and responsible use  of the tools; learn how to create effective prompts and to identify potential weaknesses in the outputs   Relevant: make sure the use of generative AI tools supports user  and organizational needs and contributes to improved outcomes for Canadians; identify appropriate tools for the task; AI tools aren’t the best choice in every situation  For assistance in determining the appropriate use of these tools  public servants should engage with relevant stakeholders such as their institution’s legal services  privacy and security experts  Chief Information Office  Chief Data Office and diversity and inclusion specialists. As well  the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security  Statistics Canada and the Office of the Chief Information Officer at TBS are also available to support federal institutions in the responsible use of these tools.  Policy considerations and best practices  Does the Directive on Automated Decision-Making apply  The Directive on Automated Decision-Making applies to automated systems  including those that rely on AI  used to influence or make administrative decisions. Like other AI systems  generative AI systems have capabilities that allow them to make assessments or determinations about clients in service delivery. For example  a generative AI system could be used to summarize a client’s data or to determine whether they  These administrative uses have the potential are eligible for a service.   8  6 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     to affect how an officer views and decides on a case  which has implications for the client’s rights  interests or privileges. The directive therefore applies to the use of generative AI systems to make or inform administrative decisions.  However  generative AI may not be suited for use in administrative decision-making at this stage. The design and functioning of generative models can limit federal institutions’ ability to ensure transparency  accountability and fairness in decisions made by generative AI systems or informed by their outputs. As well  the terms of use for the generative AI products of many leading technology companies prohibit using their products to make high-impact decisions. For example  OpenAI instructs users not to employ ChatGPT in decisions about credit  employment  educational institutions  or public assistance services; law enforcement and criminal justice; and migration and asylum.  prohibits users of their generative AI product from making “automated decisions in domains that affect material or individual rights or well- being.”   These limitations underscore the importance of complying with the directive’s requirement to consult legal services during the design phase of an automation project. The consultation allows federal institutions to understand the legal risks of administrative uses of generative AI systems both for themselves and for their clients.   Similarly  Google  10  9  Not all uses of generative AI are subject to the directive. For example  using generative tools in research or to brainstorm  plan  or draft routine correspondence falls outside the scope of the directive. However  such non-administrative uses are still subject to the laws and policies that govern federal institutions.  Privacy considerations  7 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     As with any online system  personal information should not be entered into a generative AI tool or service unless a contract is in place with the supplier and covers how the information will be used and protected. Before using a generative AI tool  federal institutions must also make sure that the collection and use of personal information  including information used to train the tool  meets their privacy obligations.  All personal information used by  created or obtained through  and disclosed for the use of generative AI by federal institutions is subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act and related policy instruments. This means that:   personal information can only be collected if it is directly related to  the program or activity   it may only be used for the purpose for which it was collected or for a  use consistent with that purpose   it has limited permissible disclosures outlined in the legislation  institutions must be transparent about how they treat and safeguard  the personal information they collect once it is under the control of the government  The privacy risks will vary based on how the AI tool collects and processes information about individuals and  potentially  makes decisions about them. An AI tool could  for example  decide whether someone is eligible for a service  determine the level of benefit someone is entitled to  or process survey data to inform policy direction.  The Privacy Act requires that a government institution take all reasonable steps to ensure that personal information that is used for an administrative purpose by the institution is as accurate  up-to-date and complete as possible. When using a generative AI system to make or  8 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     inform decisions about individuals  federal institutions must have confidence that the personal information the system collects  creates or uses is accurate. For this reason  direct collection from the individual is required in most situations. Direct collection also allows for the individual to be notified of the collection and of how their information will be used and managed.  If the output of a generative AI tool results in the creation of new personal information  the new information must also be managed according to privacy requirements. For example  a summary of an application for a service or benefit produced by a generative AI tool could constitute new personal information. Users should validate any personal information created by a generative AI tool to make sure that it is accurate  up-to-date and complete. As well  users must ensure that any new personal information is not disclosed for a purpose that is inconsistent with that for which it was collected. From the example above  sharing the new information about the individual with a different program for an unrelated benefit may not be appropriate and may constitute a privacy breach.  Federal institutions must also make sure that all personal information they collect and use can be made available to the individual concerned and that the individual can access and correct it upon request. Federal institutions must retain personal information that is used to make a decision about an individual for at least two years. This gives the individual enough time to exercise their right to access and correct the information. Federal institutions should not hold onto personal information for longer than required. The longer federal institutions hold personal information  the greater the likelihood of a potential privacy breach.  9 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     De-identification and the use of synthetic data can help institutions reduce the impact and likelihood of privacy breaches when training  using and evaluating the outputs of generative AI tools. Privacy Implementation Notice 2023-01: De-identification contains more information about these privacy preserving techniques. Other safeguards such as administrative controls  access rights  and auditing are also important to reduce the risk of inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized access  re-identification or inference  and to generally preserve the privacy of individuals.  Before considering procuring  using or deploying generative AI tools  federal institutions’ privacy officials must determine whether a Privacy Impact Assessment is needed.  When federal institutions are building IT solutions that use generative AI  they must make sure they meet privacy requirements. The Digital Privacy Playbook contains more information on these requirements and on how to incorporate privacy guidance into IT solutions that use generative AI.  Potential issues and best practices The following section provides a brief overview of several areas of risk and sets out best practices for the responsible use of generative AI in federal institutions. In addition to the best practices identified for all users of generative AI in the federal government  best practices specific to federal institutions developing or deploying these tools are also identified to ensure that risks are appropriately assessed and mitigated  and to distinguish between the responsibilities of users and developers.  Protection of information  Issue: some generative AI tools do not meet government information security  10 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     requirements The protection of personal  classified  protected and proprietary information is critical when using generative AI systems. The providers of some generative AI tools may inspect input data or use this data to further train their models  which could result in privacy and security breaches. Risks can also arise from input data being stored on servers not controlled by the GC  where data might be retained for longer than necessary  made accessible  further distributed  or vulnerable to a data breach.   Some tools  public or otherwise  may not meet privacy and security requirements established in federal law and policy.  11  Best practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions   Don’t enter sensitive or personal information into any tools not  managed by the GC.   Don’t submit queries on non-GC managed tools that could  undermine public trust if they were disclosed. Refer to Appendix B of the Directive on Service and Digital for examples of unacceptable uses.  Understand how a system uses input data (for example  whether it’s  used as training data or accessible to providers).   Ask legal services and the departmental chief security officer (CSO)  to review a supplier’s terms of use  privacy policy and other legal documents before using any system to process sensitive or proprietary information.   Use infrastructure and tools that are appropriate for the security  classification of the information  in accordance with the Directive on Security Management.   Consult the departmental CSO before using  procuring or deploying  generative AI for protected or other sensitive information.   Consider the requirements for information and data residency in the  11 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     Directive on Service and Digital and the related guidance in the Guideline on Service and Digital.   Use the “opt-out” feature  where possible  to ensure that prompts  are not used to train or further develop an AI system.  Additional best practices for federal institutions deploying a generative AI tool   Conduct regular system testing prior to and throughout the  operation of a system to ensure that it meets key performance targets.   Plan independent audits for assessing generative AI systems against  risk and impact frameworks.  Bias  12 13 14  Issue: generated content may amplify biases or other harmful ideas that are dominant in the training data Generative AI tools can produce content that is discriminatory or not representative  or that includes biases or stereotypes (for example  biases relating to multiple and intersecting identity factors such as gender  race and ethnicity).   Many generative models are trained on large amounts of data from the Internet  which is often the source of these biases. For example  training data is likely to reflect predominant historical biases and may not include perspectives that are less prevalent in the data or that have emerged since the model was trained.   Other sources that may contribute to biased content include data filtering  which can amplify the biases in the original training set    framing of the prompt    and model bias. Widespread use of these technologies could amplify or reinforce these biases and dominant viewpoints  and lead to less diversity in ideas  perspectives and language     as well as  12 17  12  15  16  12 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     potential harms.  Best practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions  Review generated content to ensure that it aligns with GC  commitments  values and ethics and meets legal obligations. This includes assessing for biases or stereotypical associations.   Formulate prompts to generate content that provides holistic  perspectives and minimizes biases.   Strive to understand the data that was used to train the tool  for  example  where it came from  what it includes  and how it was selected and prepared.   Learn about bias  diversity  inclusion  anti-racism  and values and ethics to improve your ability to identify biased or discriminatory content.   Notify recipients when content has been produced by generative AI.  Additional best practices for federal institutions deploying a generative AI tool   Consider potential biases and mitigation approaches from the  planning and design stage  including by completing a gender-based analysis plus (GBA Plus) to understand how your deployment of generative AI tools might impact different population groups.   Consult GBA Plus and other diversity and inclusion experts in your organization to identify impacts of the use of generative AI tools on different population groups and to develop measures to address those impacts.   Test for biases in the data  model and outputs before deploying a  system  and on an ongoing basis.  Quality  13 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     Issue: generated content may be inaccurate  incoherent or incomplete Generative AI technologies can produce content that appears to be well developed  credible and reasonable but that is in fact inaccurate  nonsensical or inconsistent with source data.   This content is sometimes referred to as a “hallucination.” Also  content generated by AI tools may not provide a holistic view of an issue. Instead  it may focus on prevalent perspectives in the training data.  date  depending on the time period the training data covers and whether the system has live access to recent data. The quality of the tools and outputs in different languages should also be considered to ensure compliance with official languages requirements.   It also might be out of  18 19  12  20  The risks associated with inaccurate content will vary based on the context and should be assessed. For example  using generative AI tools to learn about a topic may produce incorrect information or non-existent sources   treatment of individuals or misguided policy. As well  the use of generative AI tools for public-facing communications could result in the government sharing inaccurate information  which would contribute to misinformation and erode public trust.   which  if used in decision-making  could lead to unfair  Best practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions   Clearly indicate that you have used generative AI to develop content.  Don’t consider generated content as authoritative. Review it for  factual and contextual accuracy by  for example  checking it against information from trusted sources.   Review personal information created using generative AI to ensure it  is accurate  up-to-date and complete.   Assess the impact of inaccurate outputs. Don’t use generative AI  when factual accuracy or data integrity is needed.  14 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca      Strive to understand the quality and source of training data.  Consider your ability to identify inaccurate content before you use generative AI. Don’t use it if you can’t confirm the content quality.   Learn how to create effective prompts and provide feedback to refine outputs to minimize the generation of inaccurate content.  Additional best practices for federal institutions deploying a generative AI tool   Make sure the quality of tools and outputs meets official languages  requirements before deployment.   Notify users that they are interacting with generative AI.  Use watermarks to help users identify content generated by AI.  When content is generated by AI  provide links to authoritative sources and encourage users to verify the content at the links provided.   Provide information about the source of training data and how  models were developed.  Public servant autonomy  Issue: overreliance on AI can unduly interfere with judgment  stifle creativity and erode workforce capabilities Overreliance on generative AI tools can interfere with individual autonomy and judgment. For example  some users may be prone to uncritically accept system recommendations or other outputs  which could be incorrect.   Overreliance on the system can be a sign of automation bias  which is a tendency to favour results generated by automated systems  even in the presence of contrary information from non-automated sources.   As well  confirmation bias can contribute to overreliance    because the outputs of generative AI systems can  21 22  21  21  15 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     23   Overreliance on  reinforce users’ preconceptions  especially when prompts are written in a way that reflects the user’s assumptions and beliefs.  AI systems can result in a decline in critical thinking and can limit diversity in thought  thereby stifling creativity and innovation and resulting in partial or incomplete analyses. Overreliance on AI can impede employees’ ability to build and maintain the skills they need to complete tasks that are assigned to generative AI systems. This could reinforce the government’s reliance on AI and potentially erode workforce capabilities.  Best practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions   Consider whether you need to use generative AI to meet user and  organizational needs.   Consider the abilities and limits of generative AI when assigning  tasks and reviewing system outputs.   Build your AI literacy so that you can critically assess these tools and  their outputs.   Use generative AI tools as aids  not as substitutes. Do not outsource  a skill that you do not understand or possess.   Form your own views before you seek ideas or recommendations  from AI tools.   Learn how to write prompts that are likely to result in content that  provides a holistic perspective and minimizes biases.   Always review content generated by AI  even if the system seems to  be reliable in providing accurate responses.  Legal risks  Issue: generative AI poses risks to human rights  privacy  intellectual property protection  and procedural fairness  16 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     The government’s use of generative AI systems poses risks to the legal rights and obligations of federal institutions and their clients. These risks arise from the data used to train AI models  the way systems process input data  and the quality of system outputs.  The use by suppliers or federal institutions of copyright-protected materials like articles  books  code  paintings or music to train AI models may infringe intellectual property rights. The use or reproduction of the outputs generated by these models could also infringe on such rights if they contain material that is identical or substantially similar to a copyright-protected work. Further  the ownership of content created by or with the help of generative AI is uncertain. Privacy rights could also be at risk because data used to train generative AI models could include unlawfully collected or used personal information  including personal information obtained from publicly accessible online sources.  Risks could also arise from the opacity of generative AI models and their potential for producing inaccurate  biased or inconsistent outputs. This opacity makes it difficult to trace and understand how the AI system produces outputs  which can undermine procedural fairness in instances where a federal institution is obliged to provide clients with reasons for administrative decisions  such as decisions to deny benefits. The quality of AI outputs can also impact individuals’ legal rights. For example  biased outputs could lead to discrimination in services  potentially violating human rights.  These risks extend beyond decision-making scenarios. When federal institutions use generative AI tools to help the public find information (as is the case  for example  with the use of chatbots on departmental websites) or to produce public communications  there’s a risk that these tools will generate inappropriate content or misinformation that could  17 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     contribute to or cause harm for which the government could be liable.  Best practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions   Consult your institution’s legal services about the legal risks of  deploying generative AI tools or using them in service delivery. The consultation could involve a review of the supplier’s terms of use  copyright policy  privacy policy and other legal documents.   Comply with the Directive on Automated Decision-Making when using  generative AI in administrative decision-making.   Check whether system outputs are identical or substantially similar  to copyright-protected material. Give proper attribution  where appropriate  or remove this material to minimize the risk of infringement of intellectual property rights.   Consult designated officials on the licensing and administration of  Crown copyright if you are planning to include outputs in public communications  in accordance with the Procedures for Publishing.   Evaluate the quality of outputs for factual inaccuracies  biases or  harmful ideas that may conflict with GC values.   Keep up-to-date on legal and policy developments related to AI  regulation.  Additional best practices for federal institutions deploying a generative AI tool   Verify the legality of the method used to obtain data for training AI models and make sure you have permission to use the data for this purpose. Where feasible  train your model using open-source data that has no restrictions on such use.   Be transparent about your use of generative AI  including by  notifying users if they are interacting with a system rather than a human. Where relevant  include a disclaimer to minimize liability  18 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     risks.   Use watermarks to help users identify generated content.  Distinguishing humans from machines  24  Issue: people may not know that they are interacting with an AI system  or they may wrongly assume that AI is being used Conversational agents or chatbots that use generative AI can produce responses that are so human-like that it may be difficult to distinguish them from those of a real person.   As a result  clients may be misled into believing that they are interacting with a human. Similarly  clients might assume that an email they have received was written by a person when it was actually generated by an AI tool. On the other hand  clients might think they are interacting with an AI tool when they are actually dealing with a real person. Transparency about whether a client is interacting with a person or a chatbot is essential to ensure that the client is not misled and to maintain trust in government.  Best practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions   Clearly communicate when and how the GC is using AI in interactions  with the public.   Inform users when messages addressed to them are generated by  AI.  Additional best practices for federal institutions deploying a generative AI tool   Consider offering non-automated means of communicating with the  GC.   Use watermarks so that users can identify content generated by AI.  Publish information about the system  such as a plain-language  description of how it works  the reasons for using it  and the quality  19 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     assurance steps taken.  Environmental impacts  Issue: the development and use of generative AI systems can have significant environmental costs The development and use of generative AI systems can be a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions come not only from the compute used to train and operate generative models but also from the production and transportation of the servers that support the AI programs.  climate change  its use must be balanced against the need for swift and drastic action to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and avert irreversible damage to the environment.    While generative AI has the potential to help combat  26  25  Best practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions   Use generative AI tools hosted in zero-emission data centres.  Use generative AI tools only when relevant to program objectives  and desired outcomes.  Additional best practices for federal institutions deploying a generative AI tool   Consider whether your AI supplier has set any greenhouse-gas  reduction targets.   27   Complete an environmental impact assessment as part of the  proposal to develop or procure generative AI tools. Make sure any decision to procure these tools is made in accordance with the Policy on Green Procurement.  Use of this guide and additional support  20 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     available As departments further evolve their guidance on use of generative AI  this document is to be used as overarching guidance to build from. For more information  including guidance on specific uses of generative AI  contact the TBS Responsible Data and AI team (ai- .gc.ca). Additional resources exist within the federal government which institutions can access by contacting the Communications Security Establishment (including Canadian Centre for Cyber Security’s guidance on generative AI) and Statistics Canada. The community of practice and the TBS guide will continue to evolve over the next number of years.  Frequently asked questions ▾ Can I use generative AI to draft emails or briefing notes   Yes. Depending on the context  you can use a generative AI tool to support drafting of emails or briefing notes that don’t contain personal or sensitive information. The person generating the content is responsible for making sure that:      input data does not include protected  classified or other  sensitive information   generated content is accurate  non-partisan  unbiased  and  doesn’t violate intellectual property laws   management is notified that a generative tool was used in the  development of the product  ▾ Can I use generative AI to develop content for public communications (for example  web posts  social media)   21 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     Use caution. When you generate content  you are responsible for making sure it is accurate  clear  non-partisan and unbiased. You are also responsible for making sure permissions to reproduce  adapt  translate or publish third-party material have been secured and that the content does not violate intellectual property laws. You should also inform the public of any significant use of generative AI in the production of content. It is also critical to ensure that outputs are trusted given the potential reach and impact of public communications.  ▾ Can I use generative AI for programming tasks   Yes  but you must consider the security classification of the code. Also  when it comes to code generation  some generative AI tools can produce content that violates the open-source licences of the source code they were trained on. To address this issue  use available tools to identify potential matches in public code repositories or limit the use of generative AI to tasks like debugging or code explanation.  ▾ Can I use generative AI to inform policy   Yes  but you must be mindful of the strengths and limits of generative AI tools and tailor the tasks you assign to them accordingly. You can use these tools to assist with research during policy development  but don’t use them to recommend  make or interpret policy.  When deciding on policy positions  make your own value judgments  in consultation with the relevant stakeholders and consistent with  22 of 27  10/31/2023  9:45 PM   Guide on the use of Generative AI - Canada.ca     applicable laws. Strive to be transparent and vigilant about any significant use of generative AI during the policy process  including in research and stakeholder engagement. The prompts used in such contexts should not include any information that would pose legal or reputational risks to the government.  ▾ Can I use generative AI to automate assessments  recommendations or decisions about clients   Use caution when considering whether to use generative AI in administrative decision-making. Carefully consider how you will comply with the Directive on Automated Decision-Making  which seeks to ensure transparency  accountability and fairness in decisions made or informed by automated systems such as those that use generative AI. For example  make sure that you understand how the tool produces its outputs and that you can find the data it relied on. You should assess outputs for factual accuracy and undue bias toward clients. You should also consider potential variation in outputs produced in response to similar prompts  which could lead to inequalities in the treatment of clients.

It also   complements  and benefits from  the historic investments  Canada is making in its national defence and security  through its 2024 defence policy update Our North    Strong and Free.   It will make Canada more secure  especially for Canadians  living in the North. It will support strong and resilient Arctic  and Northern communities. It will also serve to advance the  interests and priorities of Indigenous Peoples and   northerners who call the Arctic home.  Canada’s new policy is based on a shared vision of the   Arctic’s future; I am confident Canada will realize its   ambitions through this policy.  The Honourable Mélanie Joly  P.C.  M.P.  Minister of Foreign Affairs  Canada is at an inflection point in the Arctic.   For many years  Canada has aimed to manage the Arctic  and northern regions cooperatively with other states as a  zone of low tension that is free from military competition  This approach had significant benefits  uniting the Arctic  nations to advance cooperation on issues of common  interest  such as sustainable development  environmental  protection and scientific collaboration  including through   the establishment of the Arctic Council in Ottawa in 1996.  However  the guardrails that we have depended on to  prevent and resolve conflict have weakened. Russia’s illegal  war in Ukraine has made cooperation with it on Arctic issues  exceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future. Uncertainty  and unpredictability are creating economic consequences  that Canadians are facing everyday.  Threats to Canada’s security are no longer bound by  geography; climate change is accelerating rapidly; and  non-Arctic states  including China  are also seeking greater  influence in the governance of the Arctic. To respond   Canada must be strong in the North American Arctic  and  it requires deeper collaboration with its greatest ally  the  United States. Canada must also maintain strong ties with   its 5 Nordic allies  which are now also all NATO members.  The evolving security and political dynamics in the   Arctic have triggered a need for a recalibrated diplomatic  approach to advancing Canada’s national interests in the  region  based on the principles of pragmatic diplomacy.   The Arctic Foreign Policy  a diplomatic strategy  addresses  the challenges and opportunities Canada faces today  as  well as those it expects to face in the coming decades. It  gives Canada the diplomatic tools it needs to continue to  assert its sovereignty  advance its national security interests  and promote a stable  prosperous and secure Arctic.   This policy is built on  and benefits from  the knowledge  and perspectives of Indigenous Peoples who call the Arctic  home. It comes from a place of understanding that there is  a dark chapter in Government of Canada policy in the Arctic   which includes forced relocations of Inuit to the High Arctic  and other colonial policies. These have inflicted significant  intergenerational trauma on Indigenous Peoples.   2  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Foreword: Message from   the\\tMinister\\tof\\tNorthern\\tAffairs  The new Arctic Foreign Policy will expand and broaden  Canada’s international engagement  strengthen relations  with our international partners and exercise Canada’s   sovereignty in the Canadian Arctic. It will also advance  domestic priorities  including enhancing knowledge of   the North  protecting the Arctic environment  and   advancing reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples   throughout the North.   By placing the invaluable perspectives  knowledge  and  wisdom of Indigenous Peoples in the North  who have  called the Arctic home since time immemorial  at the  foreground this new policy and its implementation  we will  ensure that the Arctic remains a vibrant  prosperous  and  secure region now and for future generations.  The Honourable Dan Vandal  P.C.  M.P.  Minister of Northern Affairs  Released in 2019  the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework  (‘the Framework’) was co-developed with over 25 First  Nations  Inuit  and Métis governments  organizations   and territorial and provincial governments. It laid out a  shared vision to ensure that the needs and priorities of the  North remain paramount: “Strong  self-reliant people and  communities working together for a vibrant  prosperous and  sustainable Arctic and northern region at home and abroad   while expressing Canada’s enduring Arctic sovereignty.”   The launch of Canada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy builds on  the International Chapter of the Framework and is a pivotal  moment in the realization of our shared vision for the Arctic.  Informed by engagements with Indigenous Peoples and  Northerners and their vast knowledge in the region  as well  as with territorial and provincial governments  this Policy  reflects the federal government’s international approach to  the Arctic to ensure that Canada remains well-positioned   as an Arctic leader.   The Arctic Foreign Policy will promote a safe  strong    and thriving future for those who live in the Arctic and   the North  while protecting Canada’s enduring Arctic   sovereignty. It considers the shifting geopolitical context  and puts forward plans to ensure that the Canadian Arctic  remains strong and adaptable on the international stage   now and into the future. Just as Indigenous partners are  instrumental in the ongoing implementation of the   Framework  the success of this new foreign policy will  depend on continued learning from the immeasurable  experience  knowledge  and wisdom of First Nations  Inuit   Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-Governing partners and  communities. This shared learning is critical to a strong and  sustainable Arctic and to the full and effective implemen- tation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples Act.   Through this Policy  Canada’s approach to the Arctic will be  developed with respect for Indigenous self-determination  and the values  interests  cultures  and traditions of Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples  including weaving   traditional knowledge into Arctic decision-making   at the global level.   3  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Foreword: Message from   the Minister of National Defence  Canada remains committed to contributing to NATO   and NORAD’s awareness of the threat environment across  the Arctic region  including in the North American Arctic.   We likewise support the continued leadership of   like-minded Arctic states on matters of security   and defence.  The Arctic security and continental defence investments  made in Our North  Strong and Free and NORAD   Modernization support NATO’s deterrence and   defence agenda by protecting the Alliance’s Northern   and Western flanks. It ensures that Canada can engage   in the world and deploy from a secure base in support   of NATO allies  when needed.  As we expand and enhance our presence in the Arctic  we  recognize that this will also impact the communities who  inhabit the region. Indigenous Peoples have called the  Arctic home since time immemorial  and working with them  will enhance the prosperity and defence of the region.   Our government will continue to prioritize working with   Indigenous communities in the Arctic and deepening   our relationship with them.  As the world continues to evolve and threats intensify    the connection between foreign policy and defence policy  must remain strong for the protection of our country   and our values. This Arctic Foreign Policy complements  Canada’s ongoing work in the region to expand our   presence and safeguard our sovereignty in the Arctic.   The Honourable William Sterling Blair  P.C.  C.O.M.  M.P.  Minister of National Defence  Canada has benefited enormously from our geography.  Surrounded by 3 oceans  and our closest ally to the south   our country has enjoyed a degree of protection that has  helped keep our borders safe and secure. That reality is  changing in the Arctic. Where the polar ice caps provided  physical protection  the region is now opening to the world  as it warms at 4 times the global average.  In the coming decades  the Arctic Ocean will become a vital  shipping route between Europe and Asia  while vast stores  of natural resources become increasingly accessible.   This growing access is already enticing nations to   the region  heightening security challenges and   geopolitical competition.   Canada must urgently strengthen our presence in the Arctic  and northern regions as our adversaries aspire to a greater  role in the region’s affairs. The physical threat of climate  change is compounded by challenges from authoritarian  states to the rules-based international order that Canada  and its allies strive to uphold. Simultaneously  the character  of conflict is changing with rapid technological and   cyber advances.     Canada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy responds to these  growing challenges by focusing on 3 key areas: asserting  Canada’s sovereignty  advancing our interests in the region   and promoting a stable  prosperous  and secure North.   The policy addresses current needs and challenges while   anticipating how the region will change in the coming  decades. It also provides the diplomatic tools we need  to partner with Northern communities to assert Canada’s  sovereignty and to support Arctic and Northern people   so that they can thrive and remain secure.  The Arctic Foreign Policy complements the work and   investments outlined in our new defence policy update   Our North  Strong and Free  which was developed in part as  a response to the emerging threats in the Arctic and around  the world. Our North  Strong and Free focuses on   Canadian values and strengths while underpinning   our Arctic and Northern sovereignty  strengthening our   diplomatic influence  and leveraging our world-leading  cyber and space talent. It reinforces our capabilities and  capacity in the region  in partnership with those   who live there.  4  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Executive summary  Canada is an Arctic nation.  Canada launched the co-developed Arctic and Northern  Policy Framework (ANPF) in 2019  which sets out a   common vision of the Arctic and the North  in which   the peoples there are thriving  strong and secure.   Since then  strategic competition has intensified across the  globe as major powers that do not share Canadian interests  and values seek to shape the international environment to  their advantage. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022   for example  has shaken the foundations of international  cooperation in the Arctic.   At the same time  the Arctic is experiencing the   considerable impacts of climate change  with significant   implications for the security of the communities and people  who live in the Arctic. By 2050  the Arctic Ocean will become  an increasingly viable shipping route between Europe and  Asia during the summer.  More than ever  the Arctic is a theatre of interest for many  non-Arctic states and actors aspiring for a greater role in  Arctic affairs. Canada’s adversaries also try to achieve   influence through non-military tactics  including cyber  activities  foreign interference and economic coercion.  The North American Arctic is no longer free from tension.  Canada must work even closer with its closest ally  the   United States  to maintain a secure North American  homeland. Canada should also be closer than ever   to its Nordic allies.  To respond to these emerging geopolitical dynamics   and to align more closely with the defence policy update   Our North  Strong and Free  Canada has developed  in   partnership with northern and Indigenous Peoples  the  Arctic Foreign Policy to supplement the International   chapter of the ANPF. This policy will help ensure that the  Arctic remains a stable  prosperous and secure region   for future generations.  The Arctic Foreign Policy provides new funding over   the next 5 years to ensure that Global Affairs Canada1   is fit-for-purpose in the Arctic. The policy also benefits   Canadians who live in the Arctic and in the North    including by strengthening their ties and connections   across borders.   To achieve its objective of a stable  prosperous and secure  Arctic  Canada will continue to assert its sovereignty. Canada  will also advance its national interests through pragmatic  diplomacy; lead on Arctic governance and multilateral  challenges; and adopt a more inclusive approach   to Arctic diplomacy.  As part of this policy  Canada will:    appoint an Arctic ambassador     open a new consulate in Anchorage  Alaska    open a new consulate in Nuuk  Greenland    initiate an Arctic security dialogue with the ministers   of foreign affairs of like-minded states in the Arctic    expand information sharing with relevant territorial and  provincial governments and Indigenous leaders on  emerging and developing international Arctic security  trends  including foreign interference threats    support science and research coordination initiatives   with foreign policy considerations as related to research  security and science in the Arctic     launch boundary negotiations with the United States   regarding the Beaufort Sea and finalize the implementa- tion of the boundary agreement between Canada   and the Kingdom of Denmark regarding Tartupaluk   (Hans Island)  Canada remains deeply committed to the full implementa- tion of the ANPF  to Arctic state primacy and to upholding  the rules-based international order2 in the Arctic. The Arctic  Foreign Policy will provide new tools for Canada to deliver  on the objectives set out in the ANPF in a changing   geopolitical context.  This foreign policy will secure its national interests   and ensure stability and prosperity for the Indigenous   Peoples who live in the Arctic and the North—including   First Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-  Governing Partners—and other northerners. Canada’s  diplomacy is stronger when it is informed by Indigenous  Knowledge  culture and practices  as well as by the lived  experiences of northerners who call the Arctic home.  1\\t Hereafter \\tall\\tuses\\tof\\tthe\\tfirst-person\\tplural—we \\tus \\tour\\tand\\tours—are\\tin\\treference\\tto\\tGlobal\\tAffairs\\tCanada.  2\\tThe\\trules-based\\tinternational\\torder\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tis\\tthe\\tsum\\tof\\tinternational\\trules \\tnorms\\tand\\tinstitutions\\tthat\\tgovern\\tinternational\\taffairs\\tthere.  5  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy STRATEGIC  CHALLENGES   IN THE ARCTIC  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  6  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 1.  Russia     since 2022  Canada has been clear that there will be no business as usual with Russia  at the Arctic  Council or elsewhere  since its illegal  full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally changed the geopolitical  landscape  with spillover effects in the Arctic. It is an attack not only against Ukraine   but also on the fundamental principles of international relations  including respect   for sovereignty  territorial integrity and international law.   In addition to the existential threat Russian aggression poses to Ukraine and its people   Russian president Putin’s war on Ukraine risks setting a broader post-Cold-War   precedent that borders can be redrawn through violence.  Northerners understand how close a neighbour Russia is. Canada must be clear-eyed  about the implications of its geographic proximity to Russia. Canadian Forces Station  Alert  on Ellesmere Island  Nunavut  is closer to the Russian military’s air force base   at Nagurskoye  Russia  than Iqaluit is to Ottawa or Toronto is to Winnipeg.   For over a decade  Russia has invested in modernizing its Arctic infrastructure and its  military capabilities in the Arctic to develop resources and control access to the region   with particular emphasis on its own western region and approaches. It is looking to  profit from climate change in the region and will continue promoting the development  of the Northern Sea Route as a major international shipping route. Given the strategic  importance Russia places on its Arctic region  Canada expects these activities   will continue.  Russia has also intensified its disinformation campaigns  conducted below-threshold  military activities3  and crafted a vehement domestic narrative of a “hostile  unfriendly  West ” in part to justify its own militarization of the Arctic.   Russia’s historic posture has been to ensure sovereignty and control over its own Arctic  region and to limit the role of non-Arctic states in Arctic affairs. However  because of  sanctions and of its massive expenditures on its illegal war against Ukraine  Russia  is increasingly reliant on China to fund and support the development of its projects  in the Arctic. These include investments in Arctic research  oil and gas development   ports and other critical infrastructure. We anticipate this trend will continue and lead to  increased activity by China in the Russian Arctic.   Russia and China are aligned in their desire to undermine the liberal-rules-based  international system  but the power asymmetry between them often highlights the  divergence in their interests. Russia is increasingly dependent on China and is reversing  its historic posture by opening its Arctic to China. For instance  in July 2024  Russia and  China  building on their 2022 statement to cooperate in the Arctic  conducted joint  military exercises in the Russian High North. In addition  Russian and Chinese warships  have conducted joint patrols in international waters off the Aleutian Islands; the   2 countries’ coast guards have conducted joint patrols into the Bering Sea; and Russian  and Chinese military aircraft have been detected  tracked and intercepted by the North  American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) while flying in Alaska’s Air Defense  Identification Zone. This demonstrates the continued deepening of Chinese-Russian  military cooperation  particularly in the North Pacific approaches to the Arctic.  3\\t\\t“Below-threshold\\tconflict ”\\talso\\tknown\\tas\\t“grey\\tzone\\tconflict ”\\trefers\\tto\\tcompetitive\\tinteraction\\tbetween\\tstates\\tthat\\tfalls\\t  \\t short\\tof\\ttraditional\\tarmed\\tconflict\\tbut\\tgoes\\tbeyond\\tnormal\\tpeaceful\\trelations.\\tSuch\\tconflict\\tinvolves\\tactions\\tthat\\tare\\t  \\t coercive\\tand\\taggressive\\tbut\\tdeliberately\\tdesigned\\tto\\tremain\\tbelow\\tthe\\tthreshold\\tof\\tarmed\\tconflict.\\tThese\\tactions\\t  \\t could\\tinclude:\\tinformation\\twarfare\\tand\\tpropaganda;\\tcyber\\tattacks\\tand\\tespionage;\\teconomic\\tcoercion;\\tpolitical\\t  \\t interference\\tand\\telection\\tmeddling;\\tthe\\tuse\\tof\\tproxy\\tforces\\tor\\tparamilitary\\tgroups;\\tor\\t“lawfare”\\tand\\t  \\t exploiting\\tlegal\\tambiguities.  7  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Evolving    security    threats across    the Arctic  8  The Arctic is a strategically important region for the defence of North America and the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO’s) northern and western flanks. However    the defence architecture and threat picture differ across the circumpolar north.   The safety  security and defence of the Canadian Arctic comprise a fundamental  priority for the Government of Canada and are critical to the collective defence of North  America. The Arctic regions of North America are protected by the armed forces of  Canada and the United States  individually and bilaterally  and through NORAD    which is binational.  While the risk of military attack in the North American Arctic remains low  the region  represents a geographic vector for traditional and emerging weapons systems  that threaten broader North American and transatlantic security. Canada is seeing  a number of potential threats  including increased Russian activity in Canadian air  approaches  China’s regular deployment of dual-use—having both research and  military application—research vessels and surveillance platforms to collect data  and a  general increase in Arctic maritime activity. Adversaries and competitors also employ  disinformation and influence campaigns  malicious cyber operations and espionage  and foreign interference activities to target Canadians  including northerners.  Close partnership with the United States is essential to the maintenance of a secure   strong and well-defended North American homeland  on which the 2 countries’ mutual  prosperity depends. It is critical in deterring and defending against increasingly sophis- ticated threats to North America  including in the Arctic and its approaches in the North  Atlantic and North Pacific. We expect Canada–United States defence cooperation in  the Arctic to continue to grow  as it is fundamental to both countries’ national   security interests.  Strong and resilient Arctic and northern communities increase Canada’s defence  against threats. With increased tension and with competitors looking to exploit  vulnerabilities in the Canadian North  Canada must take action to build trust in public  institutions and deepen ties with like-minded states. Canada’s diplomacy and defence  and security policies must work hand in hand to keep these emerging threats in check.  The security of the European High North is also of critical importance to Canada’s  security and economic well-being.  The European High North is a contested region militarily  including threats to critical  infrastructure  maritime security  and safety  as well as access concerns. Russia has  established a strong military presence in the Arctic  including with air and naval   platforms equipped with missile systems capable of striking Europe and North   America and of disrupting Canada’s ability to project forces in support of allies and  partners. Russia’s below-threshold actions  military activities and continued weapons  testing in the European High North and the Arctic are deeply troubling.  NATO has strengthened its deterrence and defence posture  including in the European  High North  in response to the increased threat posed by Russia. The accessions of  Finland and Sweden to NATO  in 2023 and 2024 respectively  reinforced the Alliance by  bringing  among other things  their significant cold-weather experience and capabilities  to NATO  thereby bolstering its strategic posture in the European High North. Canada  was the first country to ratify each of their accessions. Canada will continue to share  information on threats in the Arctic with allies and to support NATO operations and  presence in the European High North.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Despite the changing threat picture  it is not in Canada’s strategic interest that the Arctic  becomes a theatre of military conflict. Canada will continue working with territorial   and provincial governments  Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples and allies and   partners throughout the Arctic region to enhance domain awareness  improve   information sharing and strengthen interoperability and research security.  Canada must also take action to mitigate the impact that current and emerging  defence and security threats to the Arctic have on the people who live in the region  and who now find themselves at the frontlines of geopolitical competition.

Adapting    to new    dynamics    for Arctic   governance  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has had cascading impacts on the governance of the  Arctic. While Arctic states continue to fulfill the important responsibility of governing  the Arctic region at a time of unprecedented change  like-minded countries are taking  coordinated action to ensure it is not business as usual with Russia.  The Arctic Council is the pre-eminent forum for international Arctic cooperation   and governance. It brings together the 8 Arctic states  the 6 Permanent Participant   organizations representing Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic  and observers to address   sustainable development and the environmental protection of the Arctic. The role  of Arctic Indigenous Peoples  from the foundation of the Arctic Council in 1996 to  the present  is one of the council’s greatest strengths and is unique in multilateral  governance. The council sets the bar for meaningful Indigenous engagement  which  continues to grow to this day. Arctic governance must be done with those who have  lived in the Arctic for thousands of years  recognizing the strength of shared knowledge  and decision making.   Meetings with all members of the council at the ministerial and Senior Arctic Official   levels remain on hold. Arctic states and Permanent Participants are working at the  expert and scientific level to advance important projects on climate change and  biodiversity  emergency prevention and preparedness and sustainable development.  These projects  along with the other work of the Arctic Council  are helping to drive  meaningful change for people who live across the Arctic. This unique work  done in  collaboration between the Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic and the Arctic states    is what makes the Arctic Council so valuable.  To ensure the maintenance of robust governance in the Arctic—governance that is  capable of tackling the increasing challenges and opportunities the region is facing— cooperation must continue at the Arctic Council. Canada must also identify new forums  and leverage existing ones in new ways to advance discussions on Arctic issues. Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples must be active partners in the conduct of   international relations in the Arctic.   Arctic states also meet in other regional and international forums that contribute to  upholding the rules-based international order  including the Arctic Coast Guard Forum  and the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement. The latter came into force in 2021   establishing a precautionary 16-year ban on commercial fishing on the high seas of   the Arctic Ocean.  Arctic states also play a leading role in advancing Arctic interests in broader global  efforts through the UN system  such as the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s)  ban on heavy fuel oil in the Arctic.  An extensive international legal framework applies to the Arctic Ocean. The law of  the sea  including as set out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)   determines states’ jurisdictions and their rights and obligations in various maritime  zones. These rules apply to the delineation of the outer limits of continental shelves   navigation  the management of natural resources  the protection of the marine environ- ment and other uses of the sea. Consistent with the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration4  Canada  remains committed to the orderly settlement of Arctic disputes in accordance with  international law and expects the same of other signatories  including Russia.  4\\t\\tThe\\tIlulissat\\tDeclaration\\twas\\tsigned\\tby\\tthe\\t5\\tArctic\\tOcean\\tcoastal\\tstates\\t(Canada \\tthe\\tUnited\\tStates \\tthe\\tKingdom\\tof\\t  \\t Denmark \\tNorway\\tand\\tRussia)\\tat\\tIlulissat \\tGreenland \\tin\\tMay\\t2008.\\tIn\\tthe\\tdeclaration \\tthe\\t5\\tstates\\tpledged\\tto\\tenhance\\t  \\t their\\tscientific\\tand\\tenvironmental\\tcooperation\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tOcean.\\tThey\\talso\\tcommitted\\tto\\tthe\\torderly\\tsettlement\\tof\\t  \\t overlaps\\tin\\ttheir\\trespective\\textended\\tcontinental\\tshelves \\tin\\taccordance\\twith\\tinternational\\tlaw.  11  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Canada has a clear interest in maintaining the structures of governance in   the Arctic that ensure Canada’s central role in guiding the region’s future.   Canada especially values the Arctic Council because it provides a platform   for Indigenous Peoples to help shape circumpolar affairs. Canada will not   allow Russia to undermine  through its actions  the pillars of international   cooperation in the Arctic.

Climate     change: the    overarching    threat  Climate change is both the most pressing and the most proximate threat to Canada’s  security in the Arctic and the people who live there. Its causes and effects are not  bound by countries’ official borders.  Climate change is progressing at an alarming pace  with the Arctic warming 4 times  faster than the global average  causing significant impacts on natural and human   environments. These impacts serve as threat multipliers because changing environ- mental conditions create additional opportunities for foreign adversaries and   competitors to covertly or overtly operate in the Canadian Arctic.  The total surface area of Arctic Ocean ice is shrinking  with varied implications for  maritime shipping  trade and resource extraction across the Arctic. Maritime traffic in  the Arctic will continue to increase  which will drive further foreign interest in the region.  This includes maritime traffic in Canada’s Arctic Archipelago  despite the risks and  hazards associated with the unpredictable ice conditions.  With retreating sea ice and new technologies improving navigation and accessibility   foreign activity in the Arctic will continue to increase  bringing with it related safety   security and environmental challenges. With other Arctic states  Canada must be  prepared to respond.  Climate change is also driving an increase in climate-related emergencies and   disrupting ecosystems that Arctic communities rely on for their livelihoods  with   significant implications for the security of northerners  including Indigenous Peoples   who are disproportionately affected by these changes.  Northerners  including Indigenous Peoples  have shared concerns about climate  change and their ongoing efforts to improve their resiliency in the face of increased  pressures on communities and livelihoods  food security and the destabilization of  critical and civilian infrastructure. The disappearance of year-round ice cover and  changes in the timing and durability of the floe edge; increasing subsidence due to  permafrost thaw; and a greater frequency and severity of wildfires are examples of the  impacts of climate change on Arctic communities  all of which have both material and  psychological impacts.  For instance  communities in the North are often impacted by major wildfires. In 2023   more than half of the population of the Northwest Territories had to be evacuated.   There is an ongoing need to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change in the  Arctic to reduce vulnerabilities. Canada must support Arctic and northern Indigenous  Peoples and other northerners in adapting to the environment as it is and will be—not  as one wishes it would be.   In parallel  climate change is driving interest in the Arctic as a sustainable and reliable  source of critical minerals  such as lithium  graphite  nickel  cobalt  copper and rare  earth elements integral to the transition to a low-carbon economy. For Canada and  its allies  the Arctic’s resource potential provides an opportunity to diversify critical  mineral production in partnership with territorial and provincial governments  Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples and local communities. This must be done carefully   respecting the livelihoods of local communities.   Climate change is a global problem; it requires global solutions and multilateral collaboration.  13  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 5.  Increasing     challenges to    Arctic states’    primacy  Canada’s approach to the Arctic is guided by the fundamental principle that the Arctic  should be governed by the Arctic states in collaboration with Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples. As in other regions  strategic competition in the Arctic is growing   with non-Arctic states and actors increasingly expressing foreign policy or security  aspirations  thereby pushing for greater roles in Arctic affairs.  Since 2019  there has been a growing narrative among some non-Arctic states that  they should have a greater say in Arctic governance. China  in particular  has expressed  an ambition to become a “polar great power ” by 2030.  Among China’s priorities in the Arctic are developing commercial shipping opportuni- ties  including a “Polar Silk Road ” as well as natural resource exploitation  including of  critical minerals  oil and gas and fish. China is also active in Arctic research  much   of which can be considered dual use.  China seeks to shape the international order into a more permissive environment for  interests and values that increasingly deviate from Canada’s commitment to a rules- based international system. China can be expected to use all the tools at its disposal   to advance its geopolitical interests  including in the Arctic. Canada will challenge China  when it ought to and cooperate when its interests align with China’s.  China  like all states  has rights and responsibilities related to its use of the world’s  oceans that apply equally in the Arctic. For example  in accordance with UNCLOS   China can only conduct marine scientific research in the exclusive economic zone  of another state with the consent of that state. Canada will carefully review any such  requests related to its own exclusive economic zone and provide or withhold consent  consistent with the provisions of the convention.  14  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   Photo Credit: © Global Affairs  Canada  Consistent with its Indo-Pacific Strategy and in collaboration with partners  Canada will  always act on matters of Arctic governance to protect national and northern interests   including when dealing with China. Canada will cooperate with China to address   pressing global issues—such as climate change—that have impacts on the Arctic.  In the Canadian Arctic  Canada will always work to protect Canada’s economic security   safeguard Canadian values and protect Canadians from malign influence.  Canada will continue to work closely with the United States to counter all forms   of malign influence and activity in the North American Arctic.   In the wider region  Canada will always uphold the founding principles that under- pinned the Ottawa Declaration in 1996 on the establishment of the Arctic Council.  These include Canada’s commitment to the well-being of the inhabitants of the Arctic;  its commitment to sustainable development in the Arctic region  including economic  and social development  improved health conditions and cultural well-being; its   commitment to the protection of the Arctic environment; and its commitment to  ensure full consultation with  and the involvement of  Indigenous Peoples and their   communities and other inhabitants of the Arctic on Arctic Council activities.  At all times  Canada’s engagement in the Arctic will be focused first and foremost on  promoting and defending Canadian national interests. Canada will adopt a pragmatic  approach when circumstances require it.  15  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ARCTIC FOREIGN  POLICY PILLARS  The Arctic Foreign Policy provides Global Affairs Canada  with additional diplomatic tools to support a stable   prosperous and secure Arctic and to fully implement   the objectives laid out in the International chapter of   the ANPF given the changing geopolitical context.  We will do this by continuing to assert Canada’s   sovereignty; advancing Canada’s national interests  through pragmatic diplomacy; leading on Arctic   governance and multilateral challenges; and adopting   a more inclusive approach to Arctic diplomacy.

Leveraging diplomacy to support national defence and security  The Government of Canada will continue to take a   comprehensive approach to Arctic security by prioritizing  the security  interests and priorities of the Arctic region  and northerners  as well as Canadians more broadly.  Canada’s foreign and defence policies are closely  intertwined and complementary. Effective diplomacy  is critical for shaping the international environment to  defend and advance Canadian national interests; it is   a first line of defence for Canada’s national security.   Canada’s fundamental defence and security goal is   to prevent and defuse potential crises before they can  develop into conflict.  Canada’s national security is also supported by human  security. Strong and resilient local communities are vital  to national defence.  Canada engages in the Arctic from a position of strength  thanks to the Canadian Armed Forces’ (CAF’s) presence  and capabilities  exercises and operations  including  those of the Canadian Rangers. Canadian Rangers are  active  well-respected members of their communities   and they play a critical role in demonstrating Canadian  sovereignty over the lands  waters and ice of Canada’s  North and Arctic.  Building on the NORAD modernization investments  announced in 2022  Canada’s defence policy update  Our North  Strong and Free identified the Government of  Canada’s most pressing priority as the continued asser- tion of Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and northern  regions. Canada is making investments to ensure that  the CAF has the capabilities required to operate in an  evolving geopolitical context. By 2030  Canada will have  almost tripled its defence spending from 2015.  Strengthened military capabilities will bolster the CAF’s  ability to conduct and sustain operations in the Arctic  and create opportunities for strengthened collaboration  with allies and partners. Canada regularly invites select  allies and partners to take part in Operation NANOOK   the CAF’s signature northern operation series. Canada  also works with allies and partners on multinational  research and development activities relevant to the  conduct of defence and security operations in   the polar regions.   In addition to NORAD modernization and the defence  policy update  Canada is pursuing historic investments  to increase its military capability in the maritime domain  in the Arctic. Ensuring that Canada’s internal waters in  the Arctic are well defended is a critical component of  maintaining a secure North American homeland. Canada  will maintain strong defence capabilities in its internal  Arctic waters  including in the Northwest Passage.   17  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Here is a summary of key defence   and security investments:    Several military capabilities will play a key role in   exercising Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and  northern waters  including Canada’s 6 new Arctic  Offshore Patrol Ships; up to 15 new River Class  Destroyers; 11 new MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones;   up to 16 new P-8A Poseidon multi-mission aircraft  specialized in anti-submarine and anti-surface  warfare; and 88 new F-35A fighter aircraft.     Canada’s $38.6 billion plan to modernize NORAD will  significantly enhance domain awareness in the Arctic  and the North through the establishment of a   new northern approaches surveillance system to   complement the North Warning System and further   investment in space-based surveillance. It also  includes further investment in space-based polar  communications; additional air-to-air refuelling aircraft  to support and extend the reach of CAF operations— and NORAD operations—in Canada; additional and  longer-range air-to-air missiles for Canada’s fighter  fleet; significant infrastructure upgrades at airfields  used to support NORAD forward operations; and   more than $4 billion in new funding for science   and technology.    The defence policy update announced an additional  $8.1 billion in spending over the next 5 years and   $73 billion over the next 20 years to support   Canada’s national defence and security in the Arctic.  This includes a new fleet of airborne early warning  and control aircraft; specialized maritime sensors   including some that can be deployed by Harry  DeWolf-class Arctic Offshore Patrol vessels; a new  fleet of tactical helicopters; and a new satellite  ground station in the Arctic to enhance the use of  Canadian  U.S. and other Allied space capabilities.     The defence policy update will also establish a new  network of Northern Operational Support Hubs to  further enhance the CAF’s presence  responsiveness  and partnerships across the Arctic and the North  and invest in multi-use infrastructure that also meets  the needs of the territories  Indigenous Peoples and  northern communities.    In July 2024  Canada announced it would initiate new  spending programs to put the country on track to  reach NATO’s target of 2% of GDP spending by 2032.  This will include the purchase of up to 12 convention- ally powered  under-ice-capable submarines by the  Royal Canadian Navy.    In 2024  the Government of Canada initiated the   procurement of 8 new icebreakers made in Canada  to support Canadian Coast Guard operations in the  Arctic  including 2 polar icebreakers that will enable  year-round icebreaker presence in the Arctic. The  icebreakers will contribute to the protection of the  marine environment  the resupplying of communities  and the collection of data that enhances Canada’s  maritime domain awareness in support of maritime  safety and security  climate resilience and   scientific research.    In July 2024  Canada  the United States and Finland   announced an enhanced trilateral partnership called  the ICE Pact. It is a collaborative effort to build best- in-class Arctic and polar icebreakers and other Arctic  and polar capabilities in each of the countries by  sharing expertise  information and capabilities. This  partnership also bolsters the ability of like-minded  nations to uphold international rules  norms and  standards to ensure safety and to sustain peace and  stability in the Arctic.  The diplomatic initiatives in the Arctic Foreign Policy will  complement all of these investments by better aligning  Canada’s strategic approaches and by strengthening  its relationships with its Arctic allies  with territorial and  provincial governments and with Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners.  18  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy i.  Bridging the intelligence gap  To address the complex range of threats faced in the  Arctic  Canada must conceptualize security not only in  military terms. Security in the Arctic includes community  security  research security  economic security  security  against disinformation and any other form of interference  and physical and digital infrastructure security.  We will work with Public Safety Canada to support efforts  to strengthen Canadian national resilience to counter  malign influence and activities of foreign powers. Canada  will strengthen the defence of its critical infrastructure  across the country  including in the Arctic  to protect  northern communities against foreign interference. This  can be achieved through the Investment Canada Act;  by strengthening Canadian cyber security systems; and  through new legislation to address foreign interference.  We will provide relevant territorial   provincial and Indigenous  governments with regular briefings  and information on emerging and  developing international security  trends  including threats affecting the  Arctic  to ensure that they are equipped  to support communities in Canada’s  Arctic and North and to make informed  decisions about the security of their  communities.  This will be achieved in collaboration  with the Canadian Security Intelligence  Service  the Communications Security  Establishment  the Department of  National Defence and Public   Safety Canada.

Global Affairs Canada will support the  work of Innovation  Science and Economic  Development Canada  Crown-Indigenous  Relations and Northern Affairs and its  portfolio agencies  the Department of  National Defence  Natural Resources  Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada   among others  to support the scientific  research permitting process in the Arctic   particularly for international applicants  undertaking research that can be  considered dual use.  To help ensure emerging challenges  concerning research security and science  collaboration in the North are addressed    we will help by increasing our capacity  to learn about concerns from those on  the ground  holding annual round-table  meetings on science and research relating  to Canada’s Arctic foreign policy priorities.  We will work closely with other federal  government departments and agencies   to organize the round-table meetings.  The Arctic ambassador (see Pillar 4 -  Adopting a more inclusive approach to  Arctic diplomacy) will work with Indigenous  Peoples and partners from territorial and  provincial governments  as well as across  the Government of Canada  to contribute  to the efforts to address climate change   biodiversity and other areas where  Indigenous Knowledge  science and  technologies could contribute solutions   to the challenges in the Arctic.  The Arctic ambassador will also work with  Canada’s Chief Science Advisor on issues  related to science and research.  20  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  ii.  Strengthening research security  International scientific collaboration plays an important  role in addressing gaps in knowledge of the Arctic  region  including in relation to climate change. The last  20 years have seen a marked increase in international  research activity across the Canadian and   circumpolar Arctic.   While Canada continues to welcome scientific   collaboration in the Arctic  Canada’s oversight  regu- latory  safety and security bodies must be equipped  to address potential threats and harms at all levels. In  particular  Canada must guard against foreign research  in the Canadian Arctic and North that is dual use—having  both research and military application.   This requires balancing between the important priority  of advancing recognized areas of needed international  scientific collaboration  such as climate change research   with necessary due diligence to protect Canada’s most  sensitive research.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy iii. Partnering with the Canadian Coast Guard      to support defence and security  The Canadian Coast Guard  alongside other partner  departments and agencies  is responsible for maritime  domain awareness and plays a critical role in supporting  the defence and security of the North.  Building on the Canadian Coast Guard Arctic Strategy   released in 2024  the Canadian Coast Guard will continue  to contribute to Canada’s national security  including  through its assistance to Arctic scientific   research expeditions.  The Canadian Coast Guard currently operates up to   6 icebreakers in the Arctic from June to November each  year  which helps advance maritime safety and security.  In the coming years  the Canadian Coast Guard will  acquire 8 new icebreakers  including 2 polar icebreakers  that will provide capacity for year-round presence   in the Arctic.  The Canadian Coast Guard also helps to deepen  Canadian defence cooperation with Arctic allies through  Operation Pacer Goose. The annual operation resupplies  the United States’ Pituffik Space Base (formerly known  as Thule Air Base) in Greenland  ensuring that essential  supplies are safely delivered in challenging   Arctic conditions.  To strengthen the interconnections  between the Arctic Foreign Policy  and the Canadian Coast Guard Arctic  Strategy  we will collaborate more  closely with the Canadian Coast  Guard to leverage its maritime  domain expertise and support its  work with international partners.  Through its operations and activities   the Canadian Coast Guard helps  contribute to stronger relationships with  Canada’s Arctic allies. Through deeper  collaboration  the Canadian Coast  Guard will also be able to expand its  partnerships with regional coast guards  from like-minded states.   21  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy iv. Strengthening regional defence      and security architectures  To respond to the evolving threat landscape in the Arctic   Canada will strengthen coordination and dialogue with  Arctic allies on security issues.  Alongside the Department of National Defence  we  will increase our information sharing with NATO on  circumpolar threats. We will improve interoperability and  increase the collective understanding of the evolving  security situation in the Arctic and enhance the Alliance’s  cold-weather capabilities. Canada will continue to be  an active participant in NATO exercises and operations   including in the European High North.  To ensure seamless situational awareness and informa- tion sharing on northern threats that do not recognize  borders or military command areas of responsibility   Canada supports greater coordination and collaboration  between the military forces of like-minded Arctic states   including in the context of NATO and NORAD activities.  Canada will explore and foster new partnerships to  strengthen the strategic resilience of the North American  Arctic  particularly with Alaska  the Yukon  the Northwest  Territories  Nunavut and Greenland.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  To complement existing defence forums  Canada is exploring opportunities to deepen  security dialogue among all like-minded states in the Arctic  including through regular  security discussions.    Canada will initiate an Arctic security dialogue with the ministers of foreign affairs of  like-minded states in the Arctic. Discussions will focus on sharing information on  and  on analyses of  issues relating to international Arctic relations and security; as well  as discussing national approaches to cross-cutting security challenges; advancing  opportunities for collaboration; and increasing collective resilience.  22  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Upholding the rules-based international order  The waters of Canada’s Arctic Archipelago  including   the various channels comprising the Northwest Passage   are internal waters of Canada by virtue of historic title  and in accordance with international law. Canada’s Arctic  sovereignty encompasses land  sea and ice. It extends  without interruption to the seaward-facing coasts of the  Arctic islands and beyond. These islands are joined  not  divided  by the waters between them and are bridged for  a large part of the year by ice.  Indigenous Peoples in Canada have used and occupied  the ice and waters as they have used and occupied  the lands for thousands of years. Every day  through a  wide range of activities  Arctic and northern Indigenous  Peoples and governments  as well as territorial and  provincial governments and other northerners  share  stewardship over the Arctic lands and waters of Canada.  It is through the reciprocal recognition of each other’s  mutual interests in these lands and waters that Canada  and Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples share in the  stewardship of them—further codified in modern treaties  and self-government agreements. Sovereignty and   sovereign rights in the Arctic are inextricably linked   to issues of Indigenous self-government. Canada   possesses environmental  economic  cultural and   historical interests unique to the region  the reality  and importance of which are clearly evidenced by  long-standing usage.  Canada will work with Arctic and  northern Indigenous partners to assert  shared interests and priorities in the  region  such as through partnerships  with the Inuit Marine Monitoring  Program and the Indigenous  Guardians program.5 These initiatives  provide Indigenous Peoples with  greater opportunities to exercise  responsibility for the stewardship of  their traditional lands  waters and ice.  Canada intends to continue to act as a responsible  sovereign of its Arctic territories and waters  relying on  the rules-based international order and supported by  historical and scientific evidence. Canada’s commitment  to ensuring that maritime claims are addressed in a  manner that is consistent with international law is one   of its key enduring priorities in the Arctic.

Managing Arctic boundaries through    a rules-based approach  At a time when the rules-based international order   is under unprecedented threat  it is critical that states  resolve their disputes responsibly  through dialogue  and negotiation. Canada has made resolving boundary  disputes in accordance with international law one of the  foundational principles of its foreign policy in the Arctic.  Enhanced international cooperation on maritime  boundaries also helps secure states’ respective national  interests over their resources  including energy  minerals   fish and wildlife.  Canada will advance efforts to resolve  Arctic boundary disputes peacefully  and in accordance with international  law  including UNCLOS  and in  consultation with Indigenous partners   particularly where these international  boundaries may affect treaty rights.  Canada–Kingdom of Denmark  boundary agreement  Canada  the Kingdom of Denmark  and  Greenland have resolved the maritime  boundary and long-time dispute over  Tartupaluk. In June 2022  following  5 years of intensive negotiations   the Canadian  Nunavut  Danish and  Greenlandic governments agreed  on a modernized single maritime  boundary  from the Lincoln Sea in  the north to the Labrador Sea in  the south—a distance of over 3 000  kilometres—which established the  longest bilateral maritime boundary  in the world. The agreement also  resolved the overlap in our respective  continental shelves in the Labrador Sea.  With the Kingdom of Denmark   Canada agreed to divide the island  of Tartupaluk roughly in half; Canada  is now advancing discussions on an  agreed border regime for Tartupaluk   which requires engagement with the  Government of Nunavut and local  Inuit communities. This is the last step  before the agreement can come into  force  which Canada is committed to  completing in the near future.  24  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Extended continental shelf  Canada–United States   Beaufort Sea boundary  In September 2024  Canada launched  negotiations with the United States to  resolve the 2 countries’ long-standing  maritime boundary dispute in the  Beaufort Sea. The area in question  is north of the Yukon and Alaska and  measures approximately 270 000  square kilometres. Both countries claim  jurisdiction over the disputed region  by way of differing legal interpretations  of the 1825 treaty between Russia and  Great Britain.  Reflecting the Government of Canada’s  commitment to partnership and  reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples   the boundary negotiations will involve  impacted Inuit Treaty Organizations and  close consultations with territorial and  Indigenous governments.   In December 2022  Canada filed  an addendum to its Arctic Ocean  extended continental shelf  submission with the Commission on  the Limits of the Continental Shelf  in response to Russia’s addendum   which was filed in March 2021. Russia’s  addendum greatly expanded the size  of the continental shelf included in its  submission and tripled the area that  overlaps with Canada’s own continental  shelf. Canada’s 2022 addendum  rebalanced the overlap area.  In December 2023  the United  States published the outer limits  of its extended continental shelf  in the western Arctic Ocean. This  announcement offers an opportunity  for Canada to renew negotiations  with the United States regarding the  overlap of the countries’ respective  continental shelves. These discussions  are expected to begin in late 2024.  Canada  like all Arctic Ocean coastal  states  remains committed to settling  continental shelf overlap areas  peacefully and in accordance   with international law.  25  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Advancing Canada’s interests   through pragmatic diplomacy  A fundamental principle of Canadian foreign policy is that the Arctic   should be governed by the Arctic states. This has long been a shared   principle of the Arctic states and has produced a long period    of peaceful cooperation and development in the region.   1. Strengthening Canada’s partnerships with Arctic allies  i.  The United States   The United States is Canada’s closest partner and ally   in the Arctic  and this collaboration extends across many  shared interests. Collaboration is advanced by Canada’s  extensive diplomatic network of 13 missions across the  United States and through various bilateral mechanisms.  With the United States  Canada shares a unique   relationship shaped by geography  history  shared values   common interests and strong people-to-people connec- tions. This is especially the case in the Arctic  particularly  among Indigenous Peoples  whose history  culture and  connections transcend national borders.   The Canada–United States defence partnership is  essential to maintaining a secure North American   homeland. Canada welcomes the continued partici- pation of the United States’ military and coast guard in  Canada-led exercises and operations in Canada’s   Arctic and North.  Going forward  Canada will continue to advance bilateral cooperation with the United  States in the North at all levels of government in existing areas of importance and explore  new avenues of cooperation in critical areas of national interest  including: security and  safety; the defence of North America; science and research technology; energy security;  supply chains; climate change; critical minerals; sustainable development; Indigenous  cross-border mobility; economic development; marine and terrestrial conservation; and the  protection of transboundary species  including salmon and the Porcupine caribou herd.  26  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii.   The Nordic states  Canada maintains close relations with its Nordic Arctic  neighbours; specifically  the Kingdom of Denmark  (consisting of Denmark  Greenland and the Faroe  Islands)  Finland  Iceland  Norway and Sweden. These  close relationships are underpinned by shared values   a common outlook on the world and a shared commit- ment to ensuring a peaceful and stable Arctic through  the enduring success of NATO. They continue to grow  stronger  with a particularly marked increase in dialogue  and cooperation since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now  more than ever  it is critical for Canada to have strong  partnerships with the Nordic states  as Canada and they  are all now members of NATO and Russia’s actions have  complicated cooperation in multilateral spaces of Arctic  governance. Examples of Canada’s close relationships  with its Nordic Arctic neighbours include the following:    In 2022  Canada was the first country to ratify    the accessions of Finland and Sweden to NATO.    In June 2023  Canada’s prime minister was the  invited guest at the Nordic prime ministers’   annual meeting  in Iceland.    In June 2024  the Government of Canada committed  up to $20 million in funding for an international  research initiative on the sustainable development  of the Arctic in collaboration with NordForsk  an   organization under the Nordic Council of Ministers.  It will support collaborative and multi-disciplinary  scientific efforts and contributions from across the  Arctic region and include Indigenous perspectives.    In September 2024  Canada’s minister of foreign affairs  and the premier of Nunavut co-hosted representa- tives from the Kingdom of Denmark  Finland  Iceland   Norway and Sweden for the first Canada-Nordic  Strategic Dialogue  in Iqaluit  Nunavut.    Canada is committed to deepening its partnership  with the Nordic countries as friends and allies with  common values and shared stewardship over the Arctic.  Strengthening Canada’s cooperation will also help it  respond to new threats and below-threshold activities by  its adversaries in both the North American Arctic and the  European High North.   Working in collaboration with other  federal departments  we will increase  our support for bilateral and regional  cooperation with the Kingdom of  Denmark  Finland  Iceland  Norway  and Sweden in Arctic science and  technology  climate change  culture   Indigenous-to-Indigenous ties  natural  resources  sustainable development  through trade and infrastructure and  defence and security.  We will also create a new position  in one of Canada’s Nordic missions  with responsibility for increasing  coordination and information sharing   including on security issues    with Nordic partners.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  27  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy To do this  we will open new consulates in Anchorage   Alaska  and Nuuk  Greenland.  Alaska is a key partner on a range of issues  including  border security and crossings  security and defence in  the Arctic  climate resilience and conservation  energy  security  critical minerals and Indigenous affairs.   Members of the CAF are stationed in Alaska to support  the NORAD mission and work alongside their U.S. military  counterparts in the defence of North America.  In addition  the Yukon also has mature and close-knit  bilateral relations with Alaska from both a political and  trade perspective.   iii. The North American Arctic: Alaska and Greenland  The North American Arctic encompasses the vast   northern territories of 3 countries: Alaska (the United  States) in the west; northern Canada in the centre;   and Greenland (the Kingdom of Denmark) in the east.   The relationships in this region are unique due to   geographical proximity and the ancestral relations   that exist between Indigenous Peoples  which give rise   to a number of shared interests  including on security   defence  climate change  sustainable development   critical minerals  trade  culture and Indigenous mobility.  The ANPF emphasizes increasing cooperation among  federal  territorial  provincial and Indigenous govern- ments and other organizations in and across the   Canadian Arctic and with Canada’s North American   Arctic partners.  The Arctic Foreign Policy complements this by  re-emphasizing the importance of deepening Canada’s  diplomatic engagement with its neighbours  the United  States  including Alaska  and the Kingdom of Denmark   including Greenland. This will make the Canadian and  North American Arctic more secure and create new  opportunities for economic cooperation  scientific   collaboration and cultural exchange.   The consulate in Anchorage will help promote trade and  economic ties between Canada’s territories and provinces and  Alaska; improve security and defence partnerships; strengthen  collaboration on environmental and wildlife issues; engage with  Alaskan communities  including Indigenous communities; and  support cross-border people-to-people ties.   28  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Many ties  both formal and informal  have been forged  over the years at all levels of government and between  Inuit organizations in Canada and Greenland. Several  bilateral initiatives have been advanced in recent years   including the Letter of Intent for Cooperation on the  Pikialasorsuaq (2023) and the Memorandum of Under- standing between the Government of Greenland and the  Government of Nunavut (2022). However  cooperation to  date has largely occurred organically  without an   overarching foreign policy framework.  In recognition of the growing importance of Greenland   as a key Arctic partner  a more coordinated approach  with Greenland  including with the government of   Nunavut  is a priority in ensuring that Canadian   interests are being advanced effectively.  The consulate in Nuuk will be a  valuable resource for coordinating  and advancing Canadian interests in  Greenland  enhancing bilateral and  commercial relations  facilitating  research collaboration and supporting  increased engagement and  collaboration across many   policy spaces.  We welcome Greenland’s  commitment to open a  representational office in Canada.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  29  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Holding    Russia    accountable  Russia represents a generational geopolitical challenge.  Although Russia accounts for 50% of the Arctic   geographically  bilateral cooperation between Canada  and Russia  including in the Arctic  will remain   exceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future.  Canada will continue to hold Russia accountable in regional  and multilateral forums for its actions and counter disinformation  promoted by the Russian regime  including through Canada’s  leadership of the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism. This includes  countering disinformation targeting communities   in the Canadian Arctic.   Alongside allies and partners  Canada will continue confronting  Russian aggression  including through Canada’s enduring   support for Ukraine  and by continuing to meet NATO   defence commitments.  Together with the United States  Canada will defend NATO’s  western flank  and with Arctic allies  Canada will defend NATO’s  northern regions and approaches.  Canada acknowledges that the actions of the Putin  regime do not always reflect the values of the Russian  people. This policy clearly differentiates between   government actions and those of the broader Russian  population  including its Indigenous Peoples  who them- selves have been marginalized by the Russian regime.  Across all multilateral bodies  Canada will maintain its  policy of limited engagement with Russian officials.  It is for Russia to create the conditions that will enable  a return to political engagement and cooperation by  ending its war in Ukraine and acting in accordance   with international law.  30  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   3.  Pragmatic    diplomacy    with non-    Arctic states    and actors  While Canada will continue to prioritize cooperation   with Arctic states  especially when it comes to setting  the rules that govern the region  cooperation with a  wider set of actors is beneficial and necessary to address  challenges to the Arctic emanating from global issues   such as climate change.  Given the prospect of growing competition in the Arctic   Canada will be strategic in prioritizing pragmatic   cooperation with non-Arctic states and actors that   align with Canadian values  interests and objectives.  Canada will be guided by the following principles:   › Respect for Arctic states’ sovereignty  sovereign rights and    jurisdiction in the Arctic.   › Support for the rules-based international order in the Arctic    and a demonstrated commitment to regional peace and stability.   › Respect for Indigenous self-determination  Indigenous rights and the values    interests  cultures and traditions of Arctic Indigenous Peoples  including the   participation of Indigenous Peoples in Arctic decision making  and other   Arctic inhabitants.   › Respect for the extensive legal framework that applies to the Arctic Ocean     including UNCLOS.   › Recognition of interests and expertise that are relevant to  and aligned with     Canada’s Arctic and northern priorities  as well as its national defence   and security interests.   › Maintaining a commitment to uphold and advance democratic values    human rights and gender equality according to international standards    regulations and principles.   › Openness with regard to scientific data sharing and collaboration   with Canadian researchers and local communities  including their   representative governments.   › Commitment to sustainable development  conservation  environmental    protection and fighting climate change.   Engagement with non-Arctic states and actors will be  channeled through a variety of multilateral forums  such  as the Arctic Council  appropriate UN bodies  NATO and  the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable  as well as treaties  that apply to the Arctic  such as the Central Arctic Ocean  Fisheries Agreement  and bilateral and multilateral   platforms and projects that we will drive with other  federal departments and agencies.  Going forward  based on the above principles  Canada  will place particular emphasis on cooperation with  non-Arctic states and actors in 2 regions: the North  Atlantic and the North Pacific.  31  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy The North Atlantic  Canada will strengthen engagement  on Arctic matters with the European  Union  the United Kingdom and other  key North Atlantic states through  established mechanisms  such as the  Canada–European Union Strategic  Partnership Agreement. Science   technology and innovation will remain  the focus of Canada’s cooperation with  the European Union and key European  states through Canada’s engagement  on the European Union–United  States–Canada Arctic Working Group  of the All-Atlantic Ocean Research  and Innovation Alliance; the Canada- European Union Ocean Partnership  Forum; and the Horizon   Europe program.  Other priorities for Arctic cooperation include facilitating  the mobility of Inuit between Canada and Greenland;  facilitating the trade of  and access to  the seal products  of Inuit and other Indigenous Peoples  in the E.U. market;  the conservation of fish stocks through the Canada– European Union High-Level Dialogue on Fisheries;   environmental protection; climate mitigation and   adaptation; trade and sustainable economic   development; security cooperation through   high-level dialogues; and the Canada–European   Union Green Alliance.  The United Kingdom is another close partner in the  North Atlantic based on Canada’s deep partnership   with the country and their historic ties and shared values.  The 2 countries enjoy a close-knit defence partnership   and they cooperate on shared priorities in the Arctic   including on climate change and research through   the Canada–Inuit Nunangat–United Kingdom Arctic   Research Programme.    Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  32  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy The\\tNorth\\tPacific  Canada’s Indo-Pacific Strategy recognizes that several  Indo-Pacific states are looking to the Arctic as a region  of opportunity and as a means through which to engage  with Canada.  The strategy recognizes the North Pacific as part of  Canada’s neighbourhood. The North Pacific  through  the Bering Strait  is one of the key approaches to the  North American Arctic. Canada must not undervalue the  strategic importance of these approaches—Canada’s  adversaries do not underestimate them. In line with the  strategy  Canada will explore ways to deepen Arctic  cooperation with key North Pacific states on issues of  mutual interest while also responding to the emerging  challenges some may represent.  While Canada is pleased to engage with Indo-Pacific  states making positive contributions in the Arctic accord- ing to the principles for engagement with non-Arctic  states  Canada will closely scrutinize activities of states  whose ambitions or activities are potentially counter to  Canadian values  interests or objectives in the region.  In addition to Canada’s long-standing partnership with the  United States on Arctic issues  focus will be given to increasing  cooperation with other key partners in the region—Japan and the  Republic of Korea—given the mutual long-standing relationships  and shared values of the 3 nations.  Canada will work through established forums and mechanisms   such as the Arctic Council  the Canada-Japan Action Plan for  Contributing to a Free and Open Indo-Pacific Region and the  Canada-Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership  to identify  concrete opportunities to deepen cooperation between the   4 countries on shared priorities  such as maritime security   science and technology  trade and sustainable economic   development and fisheries.  33  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Leadership on Arctic governance  and multilateral challenges  Despite\\texceedingly\\tdifficult\\trelations\\twith\\tRussia \\tArctic\\tstates\\t  continue to preside over a well-governed region operating under   extensive national and international legal frameworks.

Reinforcing      the Arctic    Council  Canada is firmly committed to the enduring value of the  Arctic Council and is adhering to its established Rules  of Procedure. Canada remains focused on continuing  the council’s important work for the benefit of the Arctic  region and the people living there  including   Indigenous Peoples.    Since 2021  our Global Arctic Leadership Initiative has  funded the establishment of a permanent secretariat  of the Arctic Council’s Sustainable Development   Working Group in Canada and provided over $2 million  in funding for more than 25 Arctic Council initiatives  with national  civil society and Indigenous partners.   The Arctic Council exists thanks in part to Canadian and  Indigenous leadership. Canada will not allow Russia’s  actions to undermine the integrity or functionality of this  important body. The people of the Arctic  who benefit so  deeply from the important work of the council  should  not be made to suffer because of Russia’s choices.     We will increase our contributions to the Arctic Council to allow for more Canadian  engagement and leadership in council projects and greater institutional support for the  council  as well as provide funding for innovative Indigenous and youth ideas in the council.  This support is critically important as the council continues to increase its activities.  Canada will increase its leadership in the council in preparation for Canada’s third chairship  of the Arctic Council  from 2029 to 2031. Working with Canadian and Arctic Council  partners  Canada will meaningfully engage the Permanent Participants from Canada   territorial and provincial governments of Canada and other Indigenous partners on the  planning and development of Canada’s Arctic Council chairship program.   Those essential building blocks will also provide guidance on how Canada engages in  other international polar processes  such as the International Polar Year: 2032 to 2033  which  is an opportunity to showcase Canada’s leadership through scientific and technological  achievements  as well as by amplifying Indigenous Peoples’ voices and   their rich knowledge.  35  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Addressing regional     and global challenges  i.  Climate change and environmental protection  While the triple crisis of climate change  biodiversity   loss and pollution is a global problem that requires  urgent collective action  the impacts of this triple crisis  are disproportionately felt by northerners. Canada has  taken a dual-track approach to addressing these issues   with engagement at the multilateral level through the  UN system and at the regional level through   the Arctic Council.  In addition to robust domestic measures to address  climate change  Canada is also working with international  partners to boost global efforts to achieve the Paris  Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C to avoid   the most devastating impacts for the world    including the Arctic.  Cutting emissions of black carbon is the most powerful  action to take to slow the pace of near-term warming in  the Arctic. For this reason  Arctic states agreed to   collectively reduce emissions of black carbon by 25%   to 33% of 2013 levels by 2025. Canada is on track to do   its part in achieving this collective goal.  Canada is also doing its part to address biodiversity loss  and advance conservation domestically and globally.  Canada continues to work toward conserving 30%   of its lands and oceans by 2030. A large part of   Canada’s protected and conserved areas fall within   Canada’s Arctic and North  and many are being   co-managed with Indigenous Peoples.6   To increase cohesiveness  we will continue to leverage  our diplomatic resources in support of all government  efforts led by Environment and Climate Change  Canada in the UN system to ensure implementation  of the historic Paris Agreement  of the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change  and of the  Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework  under the Convention on Biological Diversity.   Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  6 Final Report of the National Advisory Panel on Marine Protected Area Standards   36  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Canada’s ambassador for climate change will continue to advocate for international  partners to join Canada-led initiatives on phasing out coal; reducing short-lived climate  pollutants; finalizing a global treaty to end plastic pollution; protecting more of nature; and  other related initiatives. The ambassador will also continue to promote any other diplomatic  initiatives that address climate change. The Arctic ambassador will support this work.  Additionally  in the context of the Arctic Council’s initiatives on climate change  Canada will  continue its ongoing work at a regional level to develop scientific assessments on the  impacts of climate change and the state of biodiversity in the Arctic; to reduce short-lived  climate pollutants in the Arctic region; to encourage the use and development of renewable  energy in remote Arctic communities to exchange knowledge and implement solutions  on wildfires and climate change adaptation in an Arctic context; to develop a pan-Arctic  network of marine protected areas; and to implement the regional action plan on marine  litter in the Arctic.  Elsewhere  we will encourage all allies to join NATO’s Climate Change and Security  Centre of Excellence  which is based in Montréal. Working with the Department of  National Defence  we will also leverage the centre’s expertise to promote research and  knowledge sharing on climate security threats in the Arctic and elsewhere.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  37  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii. The Arctic Ocean  Canada’s exclusive economic zone in the Arctic Ocean  comprises more than 3 million square kilometres. This  imposes a responsibility on Canada to ensure that the  area is well managed. Canada is collaborating closely  with fellow Arctic Ocean coastal states and other   interested parties to implement the Central Arctic Ocean  Fisheries Agreement  which established a precautionary  16-year ban on commercial fishing on the high seas of  the Arctic Ocean  as well as a program for joint scientific  research and monitoring that includes Indigenous  Knowledge as a vital component to ensure that the best  available knowledge is used in decision making. Canada  is also ensuring that Inuit in Canada continue to be part  of this process.  Canada is also prioritizing the protection of the marine  environment in the Arctic Ocean in cooperation with  its like-minded international and Indigenous partners.  Canada maintains an indefinite moratorium on offshore  oil and gas development in its Arctic waters. Canada  also supports  in the absence of both a comprehensive  understanding of seabed mining’s environmental  impacts and a robust regulatory regime  a moratorium  on commercial seabed mining in areas beyond national  jurisdiction  including in the central Arctic Ocean.  Canada is committed to reinforcing rules-based  approaches in the Arctic Ocean.  We will work with other departments and agencies   to continue to develop and implement international  measures to promote safe and responsible shipping  in the Arctic  including by supporting efforts at the IMO  and the Arctic Council that complement the International  Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (known as the  “Polar Code”) and the ban on heavy fuel oil   in Arctic waters.    Across all areas of Canada’s multilateral cooperation   in the UN system  at the Arctic Council and under   the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement  it is   imperative that Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples  be meaningfully engaged in discussions when their  rights or interests could be potentially impacted.  We will continue to provide funding  to Indigenous Permanent Participant  organizations in Canada to engage  in this work. We will also advocate   alongside Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples  for the equal  treatment and inclusion of Indigenous  Knowledge and science.  In support of Fisheries and Oceans  Canada  we undertake to advocate  for the development of marine  protected areas and other effective  conservation measures in the central  Arctic Ocean under the Arctic Council   thereby enabling Arctic states to lead  by example in implementing the  UN agreement on marine biological  diversity in areas beyond   national jurisdiction.  38  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Adopting a more inclusive  approach to Arctic diplomacy  1.\\tEnsuring\\tArctic\\tdiplomacy\\tis\\tinformed\\tby\\tand\\tbenefits\\tArctic\\t   and northern Indigenous Peoples and other northerners   The Arctic is home to more than 4 million people   including Indigenous Peoples who have inhabited the  region for thousands of years. Canada is committed to  a more inclusive approach to this foreign policy that  ensures people living in the North  including Indigenous  peoples  can participate in international decision making  on matters that affect their rights or interests.  Arctic diplomacy should be informed by and benefit  Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples and other  northerners. We remain committed to this goal and  will strengthen our efforts in this area  building on the  approach adopted in the ANPF to remain open to  holding discussions within more appropriate   distinctions-based frameworks  like the Inuit-Crown   Partnership Committee.   To move forward  Canada acknowledges the damaging  impacts of colonialism on the Indigenous Peoples   of Canada’s Arctic and North. Grounded in a commitment  to reconciliation  this policy seeks to build in the Arctic  foreign policy space a renewed Inuit-Crown and   nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous Peoples  based on the recognition of rights  respect  cooperation   and partnership.  Our work on this foreign policy will be guided by the  United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous  Peoples; treaties  including land claims agreements;  self-government agreements with Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples; and the Inuit Nunangat Policy.7  Canada’s Arctic foreign policy will also be guided  by respect for territorial and provincial jurisdiction   including the devolution agreements with the Northwest  Territories  Nunavut and the Yukon.  7\\t The\\tInuit\\tNunangat\\tPolicy\\trecognizes\\tInuit\\tNunangat\\tas\\ta\\tdistinct\\tgeographic \\tcultural\\tand\\tpolitical\\tregion\\tthat\\tforms\\t40%\\tof\\tCanada’s\\tland\\tarea \\t  \\t nearly\\tthree-quarters\\tof\\tits\\tcoastline\\tand\\tsignificant\\toffshore\\tareas.\\tIt\\talso\\tacknowledges\\tInuit\\tTreaty\\tOrganizations’\\tright\\tto\\trepresent\\tthemselves\\tnationally\\t  \\t and\\tinternationally\\tand\\tthat\\tstructurally\\tthey\\tmay\\tchoose\\tInuit\\tTapiriit\\tKanatami\\tand\\tthe\\tInuit\\tCircumpolar\\tCouncil\\tto\\trepresent\\tInuit\\tat\\tthe\\tnational\\t  \\t and\\tinternational\\tlevels\\trespectively.  39  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy i.  Arctic ambassador  The geopolitical landscape in the Arctic has become increasingly complex  and competitive. To ensure that the Canadian Arctic remains a region that  is stable  prosperous and secure  we need to deepen our engagement with  like-minded states  as well as with territorial and provincial governments   Indigenous Peoples and other domestic partners.  To lead this effort  we will establish the position of Arctic ambassador.  The ambassador’s responsibilities will include making linkages between domestic issues  and those relating to Canada’s foreign affairs; serving as Canada’s Senior Arctic Official and  advancing Canada’s polar interests in multilateral forums; engaging with counterparts in  Arctic and non-Arctic states  as well as with Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic; and raising  awareness internationally of Indigenous rights in the Arctic context. The ambassador will  also support the work of Global Affairs Canada and other departments on Arctic research  security.  In carrying out these duties  the ambassador will work closely with Arctic and  northern Indigenous Peoples  territorial and provincial governments and other northerners.   The ambassador will serve as a representative in our diplomatic corps and distinguish  himself or herself by ensuring that the Arctic Foreign Policy remains connected to the reality  of Canadians living in the Arctic. The ambassador will also play an important role in Canada’s  broader efforts toward reconciliation. The ambassador will have an office in Canada’s North.

Northern and Indigenous diplomacy      on the world stage  Canada remains committed to providing international  platforms for northerners  including territorial  provincial  and Indigenous partners and youths  to engage in and to  represent their own international Arctic views  especially  on issues that impact their rights or jurisdiction. Canada  also welcomes made-in-the-North initiatives to support  homegrown policy development that enhances northern  and Indigenous diplomacy on the world stage.    a. Sub-national governments  Arctic and northern public governments play a strategic  role in Canada’s Arctic diplomacy efforts. Canada  remains committed to including territorial government  officials in the Canadian delegation to Arctic   Council meetings.     b.  Arctic and northern Indigenous diplomacy  The Arctic Foreign Policy recommits to enhancing the  representation and participation of Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples in relevant negotiations and  international forums  such as the Arctic Council and the  United Nations  including the UN Permanent Forum on  Indigenous Issues  and all other bodies that Arctic and  northern Indigenous Peoples judge to affect them.  We have heard clearly from Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners that they are looking for more than  a platform where they are only one voice consulted  among many. Instead  Indigenous partners require and  demand meaningful continuous engagement to actively  partake in and shape decision making at the international  level that reflects their roles as rights holders. We will   uphold the role of Arctic and northern Indigenous   Peoples as active partners in the conduct of interna- tional relations in the Arctic and support their efforts   to advance this goal.  The Arctic Athabaskan Council  Gwich’in Council   International and the Inuit Circumpolar Council currently  sit at the Arctic Council as Permanent Participants   with membership from Canada.  Since 2020  Canada has increased funding to the   3 Permanent Participants in Canada  allowing each of  them to receive up to $650 000 each year. This support  is strengthening Indigenous voices in international Arctic  matters  particularly at the Arctic Council.  With Transport Canada  we will  support opportunities for the Inuit  Circumpolar Council Canada to  represent Inuit Knowledge and  perspectives in international forums   including on Arctic shipping and  environmental matters at the IMO.  Canada will also support similar efforts by other Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples to increase their  representation at relevant international forums to  ensure their rights and perspectives inform decision  making at the global level. Canada will work with   Indigenous partners to identify possible ways of   improving the capacity and role of Indigenous Peoples   in international Arctic affairs.   Canada remains strongly committed to the ANPF’s  objective of providing Arctic and northern youths with  additional opportunities to participate in  and benefit  from  Canada’s international Arctic agenda. We have  leveraged support for UArctic (an international network  of universities  colleges  research institutes and other  organizations concerned with education and research in  and about the Arctic) to provide opportunities for Canadi- ans to study in different parts of the circumpolar Arctic  to  generate regional solutions and to support collaboration  in Indigenous research and education.  41  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Photos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  iii. Northern and Indigenous representation      at Global Affairs Canada  Indigenous Peoples and northerners are   underrepresented at Global Affairs Canada  and   sustained efforts are needed to boost recruitment   and retention.  In line with the Future of Diplomacy  the department is  developing a new external recruitment strategy that will  be launched in 2025. The strategy will support outreach  across Canada to identify Canadians with the skills   needed to deliver on our various mandates and will  include specific outreach to under-represented   communities  including among Indigenous Peoples   and northerners.  To support our recruitment efforts and  increase Indigenous perspectives in the  department  we will establish a paid  Arctic and northern Indigenous youth  internship program that will consider  the need of Arctic and northern  Indigenous youths to remain close   to their families and communities   and ensure that appropriate support   is in place.  We will also work with partners to  identify other avenues for increasing  the representation of Indigenous  Peoples and northerners at Global  Affairs Canada.   42  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Advancing Indigenous    and northern foreign    policy priorities  Broadening Canada’s international engagement to   contribute more directly to domestic issues  such as  closing socio-economic gaps  supporting infrastructure  development  enhancing knowledge of the North    protecting the Arctic environment and advancing   reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples  remains a priority.  Key issues include those described below.  i.  Cross-border mobility  First Nations  Inuit and Métis communities in Canada’s  Arctic and North share long-standing spiritual  cultural   political  economic  social and family connections with  Indigenous communities in the United States and Green- land. The introduction of modern international borders  and the associated controls on cross-border mobility  have negatively impacted Indigenous Peoples’ ability  to maintain familial  economic and cultural ties and  traditional practices.  Photos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  Canada has been working with  Indigenous partners and the United  States  Denmark and Greenland to find  solutions to address border crossing  and migration challenges faced by First  Nations  Inuit and Métis Peoples.   This commitment is reflected in Action  Plan Measure Shared Priorities 52 of the  Action Plan to implement the United  Nations Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples Act.   To address border mobility challenges  faced by First Nations  Inuit and Métis  Peoples who live in the United States   including Alaska  Canada intends  to bring forward legislation and  regulatory measures.  43  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii.   Market access  Indigenous Peoples also face unjustifiable barriers to  trade—barriers that also restrict international market  access to Indigenous-harvested and -produced goods   such as seal fur and ivory products.  The traditional harvesting of seals and other species by  Inuit and other Indigenous Peoples of Canada is both  a sustainable and a valuable contributor to Arctic and  northern communities. Trade barriers by key partners   such as the United States  the European Union and other  countries  have a broad detrimental impact on life in  Canada’s remote Arctic and northern communities.  In August 2024  Canada submitted  a response to the European  Commission’s review of its regulation  on the trade of seal products. Canada  requested that the European Union  repeal its regulations and replace  them with rules that offer access   to ethically and sustainably   harvested products.  Canada will continue to advocate  for a repeal of the seal product ban.  We will also promote awareness of  sustainable seal products and harvest  management by hosting officials-level  dialogues with Arctic countries and  Indigenous partners at our missions   to the European Union and the   United States.

Indigenous Knowledge and participation  Canada supports Indigenous advocacy against pervasive  colonial approaches to Arctic science and research   which marginalize and discredit Indigenous Knowledge  and participation.  iv. Indigenous languages  Indigenous languages such as Inuktut8 are essential to  the preservation of Indigenous culture and the well-  being of Indigenous Peoples and communities. Canada  will therefore enhance its efforts to work with its Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners to facilitate the  exchange of knowledge and best practices related   to Indigenous language assessment  monitoring   and revitalization.  We will continue to support  equitable research partnerships  at the international level between  Indigenous and non-Indigenous  researchers  such as the Canada–Inuit  Nunangat–United Kingdom Arctic  Research Programme.  Looking forward  we will continue  to contribute to federal efforts on  a broader range of northern and  Indigenous priorities  and we will  collaborate with Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners  territorial  and provincial governments and  other northerners on international  advocacy as appropriate. This includes  promoting investment in critical  minerals development; transportation;  energy and electrification; broadband  connectivity; cultural diplomacy; and  the conservation of the Porcupine  caribou herd. We will also work with  Indigenous partners  Canadian Heritage  and other relevant government  departments to advocate for the  repatriation from across the globe of  artifacts originating from First Nations   Inuit and Métis communities.  8\\t Inuktut\\tis\\tthe\\tfirst\\tlanguage\\tused\\tin\\tInuit\\tNunaat \\tand\\tthe\\tmajority\\tof\\tInuit\\tNunaat\\tresidents\\tcontinue\\tto\\tspeak\\tInuktut\\tas\\ttheir\\tfirst \\tonly\\tor\\tpreferred\\tlanguage.\\t  \\t Therefore \\tto\\tuphold\\tthe\\tinherent\\tdignity\\tof\\tInuit \\tsupporting\\tInuktut\\tin\\tthis\\tcontext\\tas\\ta\\tfirst\\tor\\tlater\\tlanguage\\taligns\\twith\\tthe\\tbroader\\tpurposes\\tof \\tamong\\t  \\t other\\tthings \\tworking\\tin\\tpartnership\\tto\\tdemonstrate\\tand\\tpromote\\tshared\\trespect\\tfor\\tthe\\thistory\\tand\\timportance\\tof\\tInuktut\\tand\\tfor\\tsocio-economic\\t  \\t and\\tcultural\\tdevelopment.  45  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy v.   Supporting northern and Indigenous      trade and export  In line with Canada’s inclusive approach to trade and   its Export Diversification Strategy  we are committed   to supporting northern and Indigenous exporters in   accessing global markets.  The Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) recognizes that  building strong relationships with our northern and  Indigenous partners is key to this mission. Dedicated  trade commissioners  based in regional offices for British  Columbia and the Yukon; Alberta and the Northwest   Territories; Quebec and Nunavut; Manitoba and  Saskatchewan; and Atlantic Canada  work closely with  Canadian businesses in the Arctic and northern regions  to support their global expansion. The TCS network  also continues to actively support and develop tailored  programming for northern and Indigenous exporters   including through business delegations and export  training and accelerator programs  among other ways.  Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) into northern  and Indigenous communities will also play a vital role in  economic and infrastructure development in the region.  Through our increasing engagement with Northern and  Indigenous communities via the CanExport Community  Investments program  we will continue to support  municipalities and economic development organizations  in seeking and retaining FDI in the North while ensuring  that Canada’s environmental and national security   interests are protected.    3.  Transforming Global    \\tAffairs\\tCanada’s\\tdomestic\\t   engagement processes  We are committed to pursuing an ongoing collaborative  approach to domestic engagement that is informed by  early  sustained and meaningful engagement with   territorial and provincial governments  Arctic and   northern Indigenous governments and organizations   and northerners more generally.  46  The Arctic Cooperation Advisory  Committee is a Canadian forum  for the engagement of relevant  federal departments  territorial  and provincial governments and  Permanent Participant partners on the  development and implementation of  Canada’s international Arctic policy   including Arctic-Council-related  matters. It will remain an important  mechanism for dialogue and  engagement on the development and  implementation of Canada’s Arctic  Foreign Policy.   We are committed to exploring  distinctions-based engagements with  First Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty  and Self-Governing Partners from  Canada’s Arctic and North.  For example  we are committed to  engaging directly with Inuit through the  Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee as  we apply the Inuit Nunangat Policy to  our programs  policies and services.  In addition  we will expand  opportunities for territorial and  provincial governments and Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners to  join or support Canadian delegations  at bilateral or international Arctic  meetings and treaty negotiations if  in  such meetings and negotiations  their  rights or interests could potentially   be impacted.   We will also continue to provide a  critical coordination function for  multi-stakeholder Arctic events to  support a strong Canadian presence.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy CONCLUSION  The Arctic is a region of tremendous opportunity thanks  to its plentiful resources and resilient people.   However  Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine  rapidly   advancing climate change and increasing interest in  the Arctic from non-Arctic states has led to increased  competition and geopolitical tension in the region.   To ensure that the Arctic remains stable  prosperous and  secure and to fully implement the objectives laid out  in the International chapter of the ANPF  Canada needs  a diplomatic strategy that responds to this evolving  geopolitical context.  The Arctic Foreign Policy reorients Canada’s approach  to the Arctic based on a clear-eyed assessment of the  threats Canada faces today  and those it anticipates in  the future. It aligns Canada’s foreign and defence policy  to ensure the security of Canadians and ensures that  together with its allies  Canada can guard against and  defend itself against threats from its adversaries   in the Arctic.  By reinforcing the pillars of Arctic governance and the  principles of the rules-based international order  this  policy will help to safeguard the collective interests   of the peoples of the Arctic from those who would   seek to impose their wills.   This policy will strengthen our relationships with   territorial and provincial governments  Arctic and   northern Indigenous governments and organizations   and other northerners. It will produce new and more  effective ways of working together on Arctic diplomacy  that will transform Canada’s approach   to international engagement.  Canadian diplomacy has a role to play in building  renewed relationships with First Nations  Inuit  Métis   Modern Treaty and Self-Governing Partners; relationships  that are based on the recognition of rights  respect   and partnership.  The Arctic Foreign Policy is built on a vision of shared  cooperation and prosperity for all the peoples of the  Arctic who are committed to peace and stability.   Together  we can realize this future and ensure Canada’s  place as a leader in the Arctic for generations to come.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  47  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Annex: Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   development process and Canada’s Arctic   and\\tNorthern\\tPolicy\\tFramework\\t(ANPF) \\t  published in 2019  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   development process  In the spirit of the principle of “nothing about us without  us ” the Arctic Foreign Policy was developed on the basis  of extensive and distinctions-based engagement and  on collaboration and cooperation with domestic rights  holders from Canada’s Arctic and North  including First  Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-Governing  Partners and organizations; the territorial governments  (the Northwest Territories  Nunavut and the Yukon);  and provincial governments (Manitoba  Newfoundland  and Labrador and Quebec). We engaged partners in a  variety of formats  including bilateral meetings  regional  round-table discussions and ANPF   governance mechanisms.  The Arctic Foreign Policy is guided by all relevant  treaties and self-government agreements with Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners  including obligations  Canada has to Indigenous Peoples under those treaties  and agreements  and the rights recognized and affirmed  under section 35 of the Constitution Act  1982. It is further  guided by the Yukon Northern Affairs Program   Devolution Transfer Agreement (2003)  the Northwest  Territories Devolution Agreement (2014)  the United  Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  (endorsed by Canada in 2020)  the Inuit Nunangat Policy  (2022) and the Nunavut Lands and Resources Devolution   Agreement (2024).  The policy development process was also informed by  engagement with like-minded Arctic states; specifically   the Kingdom of Denmark  Finland  Iceland  Norway   Sweden and the United States.    48  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   Canada’s ANPF  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy complements and  supports the implementation of the ANPF  which was  published in 2019. The ANPF was co-developed with  over 25 First Nations  Inuit and Métis governments and  organizations  as well as with territorial and   provincial governments.   The ANPF sets out a common vision of a future where  Arctic and northern peoples are thriving  strong and  safe. The framework includes a co-developed policy  statement and the whole-of-government International  chapter  which articulates Canada’s goals and objectives  for the circumpolar Arctic in 3 key areas that   remain in effect:  1. Strengthening the rules-based   international order in the Arctic   2. More clearly defining Canada’s    Arctic boundaries   3. Broadening Canada’s international    engagement to contribute to the priorities   of the Canadian Arctic   The implementation of the International chapter has  been supported by Global Affairs Canada’s Global   Arctic Leadership Initiative with an annual budget   of $7 million each year to strengthen Canada’s global   leadership in the Arctic.  The ANPF’s Safety  security and defence chapter also  underlines the importance of strengthening cooperation  with international partners on safety  security   and defence issues.  Canada remains committed to strengthening Arctic   and northern infrastructure and to closing infrastructure  gaps with other regions of Canada to forge opportunities   for economic development  to address reconciliation    to increase resilience and to contribute to Arctic defence  and security.

It also   complements  and benefits from  the historic investments  Canada is making in its national defence and security  through its 2024 defence policy update Our North    Strong and Free.   It will make Canada more secure  especially for Canadians  living in the North. It will support strong and resilient Arctic  and Northern communities. It will also serve to advance the  interests and priorities of Indigenous Peoples and   northerners who call the Arctic home.  Canada’s new policy is based on a shared vision of the   Arctic’s future; I am confident Canada will realize its   ambitions through this policy.  The Honourable Mélanie Joly  P.C.  M.P.  Minister of Foreign Affairs  Canada is at an inflection point in the Arctic.   For many years  Canada has aimed to manage the Arctic  and northern regions cooperatively with other states as a  zone of low tension that is free from military competition  This approach had significant benefits  uniting the Arctic  nations to advance cooperation on issues of common  interest  such as sustainable development  environmental  protection and scientific collaboration  including through   the establishment of the Arctic Council in Ottawa in 1996.  However  the guardrails that we have depended on to  prevent and resolve conflict have weakened. Russia’s illegal  war in Ukraine has made cooperation with it on Arctic issues  exceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future. Uncertainty  and unpredictability are creating economic consequences  that Canadians are facing everyday.  Threats to Canada’s security are no longer bound by  geography; climate change is accelerating rapidly; and  non-Arctic states  including China  are also seeking greater  influence in the governance of the Arctic. To respond   Canada must be strong in the North American Arctic  and  it requires deeper collaboration with its greatest ally  the  United States. Canada must also maintain strong ties with   its 5 Nordic allies  which are now also all NATO members.  The evolving security and political dynamics in the   Arctic have triggered a need for a recalibrated diplomatic  approach to advancing Canada’s national interests in the  region  based on the principles of pragmatic diplomacy.   The Arctic Foreign Policy  a diplomatic strategy  addresses  the challenges and opportunities Canada faces today  as  well as those it expects to face in the coming decades. It  gives Canada the diplomatic tools it needs to continue to  assert its sovereignty  advance its national security interests  and promote a stable  prosperous and secure Arctic.   This policy is built on  and benefits from  the knowledge  and perspectives of Indigenous Peoples who call the Arctic  home. It comes from a place of understanding that there is  a dark chapter in Government of Canada policy in the Arctic   which includes forced relocations of Inuit to the High Arctic  and other colonial policies. These have inflicted significant  intergenerational trauma on Indigenous Peoples.   2  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Foreword: Message from   the\\tMinister\\tof\\tNorthern\\tAffairs  The new Arctic Foreign Policy will expand and broaden  Canada’s international engagement  strengthen relations  with our international partners and exercise Canada’s   sovereignty in the Canadian Arctic. It will also advance  domestic priorities  including enhancing knowledge of   the North  protecting the Arctic environment  and   advancing reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples   throughout the North.   By placing the invaluable perspectives  knowledge  and  wisdom of Indigenous Peoples in the North  who have  called the Arctic home since time immemorial  at the  foreground this new policy and its implementation  we will  ensure that the Arctic remains a vibrant  prosperous  and  secure region now and for future generations.  The Honourable Dan Vandal  P.C.  M.P.  Minister of Northern Affairs  Released in 2019  the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework  (‘the Framework’) was co-developed with over 25 First  Nations  Inuit  and Métis governments  organizations   and territorial and provincial governments. It laid out a  shared vision to ensure that the needs and priorities of the  North remain paramount: “Strong  self-reliant people and  communities working together for a vibrant  prosperous and  sustainable Arctic and northern region at home and abroad   while expressing Canada’s enduring Arctic sovereignty.”   The launch of Canada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy builds on  the International Chapter of the Framework and is a pivotal  moment in the realization of our shared vision for the Arctic.  Informed by engagements with Indigenous Peoples and  Northerners and their vast knowledge in the region  as well  as with territorial and provincial governments  this Policy  reflects the federal government’s international approach to  the Arctic to ensure that Canada remains well-positioned   as an Arctic leader.   The Arctic Foreign Policy will promote a safe  strong    and thriving future for those who live in the Arctic and   the North  while protecting Canada’s enduring Arctic   sovereignty. It considers the shifting geopolitical context  and puts forward plans to ensure that the Canadian Arctic  remains strong and adaptable on the international stage   now and into the future. Just as Indigenous partners are  instrumental in the ongoing implementation of the   Framework  the success of this new foreign policy will  depend on continued learning from the immeasurable  experience  knowledge  and wisdom of First Nations  Inuit   Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-Governing partners and  communities. This shared learning is critical to a strong and  sustainable Arctic and to the full and effective implemen- tation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples Act.   Through this Policy  Canada’s approach to the Arctic will be  developed with respect for Indigenous self-determination  and the values  interests  cultures  and traditions of Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples  including weaving   traditional knowledge into Arctic decision-making   at the global level.   3  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Foreword: Message from   the Minister of National Defence  Canada remains committed to contributing to NATO   and NORAD’s awareness of the threat environment across  the Arctic region  including in the North American Arctic.   We likewise support the continued leadership of   like-minded Arctic states on matters of security   and defence.  The Arctic security and continental defence investments  made in Our North  Strong and Free and NORAD   Modernization support NATO’s deterrence and   defence agenda by protecting the Alliance’s Northern   and Western flanks. It ensures that Canada can engage   in the world and deploy from a secure base in support   of NATO allies  when needed.  As we expand and enhance our presence in the Arctic  we  recognize that this will also impact the communities who  inhabit the region. Indigenous Peoples have called the  Arctic home since time immemorial  and working with them  will enhance the prosperity and defence of the region.   Our government will continue to prioritize working with   Indigenous communities in the Arctic and deepening   our relationship with them.  As the world continues to evolve and threats intensify    the connection between foreign policy and defence policy  must remain strong for the protection of our country   and our values. This Arctic Foreign Policy complements  Canada’s ongoing work in the region to expand our   presence and safeguard our sovereignty in the Arctic.   The Honourable William Sterling Blair  P.C.  C.O.M.  M.P.  Minister of National Defence  Canada has benefited enormously from our geography.  Surrounded by 3 oceans  and our closest ally to the south   our country has enjoyed a degree of protection that has  helped keep our borders safe and secure. That reality is  changing in the Arctic. Where the polar ice caps provided  physical protection  the region is now opening to the world  as it warms at 4 times the global average.  In the coming decades  the Arctic Ocean will become a vital  shipping route between Europe and Asia  while vast stores  of natural resources become increasingly accessible.   This growing access is already enticing nations to   the region  heightening security challenges and   geopolitical competition.   Canada must urgently strengthen our presence in the Arctic  and northern regions as our adversaries aspire to a greater  role in the region’s affairs. The physical threat of climate  change is compounded by challenges from authoritarian  states to the rules-based international order that Canada  and its allies strive to uphold. Simultaneously  the character  of conflict is changing with rapid technological and   cyber advances.     Canada’s new Arctic Foreign Policy responds to these  growing challenges by focusing on 3 key areas: asserting  Canada’s sovereignty  advancing our interests in the region   and promoting a stable  prosperous  and secure North.   The policy addresses current needs and challenges while   anticipating how the region will change in the coming  decades. It also provides the diplomatic tools we need  to partner with Northern communities to assert Canada’s  sovereignty and to support Arctic and Northern people   so that they can thrive and remain secure.  The Arctic Foreign Policy complements the work and   investments outlined in our new defence policy update   Our North  Strong and Free  which was developed in part as  a response to the emerging threats in the Arctic and around  the world. Our North  Strong and Free focuses on   Canadian values and strengths while underpinning   our Arctic and Northern sovereignty  strengthening our   diplomatic influence  and leveraging our world-leading  cyber and space talent. It reinforces our capabilities and  capacity in the region  in partnership with those   who live there.  4  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Executive summary  Canada is an Arctic nation.  Canada launched the co-developed Arctic and Northern  Policy Framework (ANPF) in 2019  which sets out a   common vision of the Arctic and the North  in which   the peoples there are thriving  strong and secure.   Since then  strategic competition has intensified across the  globe as major powers that do not share Canadian interests  and values seek to shape the international environment to  their advantage. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022   for example  has shaken the foundations of international  cooperation in the Arctic.   At the same time  the Arctic is experiencing the   considerable impacts of climate change  with significant   implications for the security of the communities and people  who live in the Arctic. By 2050  the Arctic Ocean will become  an increasingly viable shipping route between Europe and  Asia during the summer.  More than ever  the Arctic is a theatre of interest for many  non-Arctic states and actors aspiring for a greater role in  Arctic affairs. Canada’s adversaries also try to achieve   influence through non-military tactics  including cyber  activities  foreign interference and economic coercion.  The North American Arctic is no longer free from tension.  Canada must work even closer with its closest ally  the   United States  to maintain a secure North American  homeland. Canada should also be closer than ever   to its Nordic allies.  To respond to these emerging geopolitical dynamics   and to align more closely with the defence policy update   Our North  Strong and Free  Canada has developed  in   partnership with northern and Indigenous Peoples  the  Arctic Foreign Policy to supplement the International   chapter of the ANPF. This policy will help ensure that the  Arctic remains a stable  prosperous and secure region   for future generations.  The Arctic Foreign Policy provides new funding over   the next 5 years to ensure that Global Affairs Canada1   is fit-for-purpose in the Arctic. The policy also benefits   Canadians who live in the Arctic and in the North    including by strengthening their ties and connections   across borders.   To achieve its objective of a stable  prosperous and secure  Arctic  Canada will continue to assert its sovereignty. Canada  will also advance its national interests through pragmatic  diplomacy; lead on Arctic governance and multilateral  challenges; and adopt a more inclusive approach   to Arctic diplomacy.  As part of this policy  Canada will:    appoint an Arctic ambassador     open a new consulate in Anchorage  Alaska    open a new consulate in Nuuk  Greenland    initiate an Arctic security dialogue with the ministers   of foreign affairs of like-minded states in the Arctic    expand information sharing with relevant territorial and  provincial governments and Indigenous leaders on  emerging and developing international Arctic security  trends  including foreign interference threats    support science and research coordination initiatives   with foreign policy considerations as related to research  security and science in the Arctic     launch boundary negotiations with the United States   regarding the Beaufort Sea and finalize the implementa- tion of the boundary agreement between Canada   and the Kingdom of Denmark regarding Tartupaluk   (Hans Island)  Canada remains deeply committed to the full implementa- tion of the ANPF  to Arctic state primacy and to upholding  the rules-based international order2 in the Arctic. The Arctic  Foreign Policy will provide new tools for Canada to deliver  on the objectives set out in the ANPF in a changing   geopolitical context.  This foreign policy will secure its national interests   and ensure stability and prosperity for the Indigenous   Peoples who live in the Arctic and the North—including   First Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-  Governing Partners—and other northerners. Canada’s  diplomacy is stronger when it is informed by Indigenous  Knowledge  culture and practices  as well as by the lived  experiences of northerners who call the Arctic home.  1\\t Hereafter \\tall\\tuses\\tof\\tthe\\tfirst-person\\tplural—we \\tus \\tour\\tand\\tours—are\\tin\\treference\\tto\\tGlobal\\tAffairs\\tCanada.  2\\tThe\\trules-based\\tinternational\\torder\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tis\\tthe\\tsum\\tof\\tinternational\\trules \\tnorms\\tand\\tinstitutions\\tthat\\tgovern\\tinternational\\taffairs\\tthere.  5  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy STRATEGIC  CHALLENGES   IN THE ARCTIC  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  6  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 1.  Russia     since 2022  Canada has been clear that there will be no business as usual with Russia  at the Arctic  Council or elsewhere  since its illegal  full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally changed the geopolitical  landscape  with spillover effects in the Arctic. It is an attack not only against Ukraine   but also on the fundamental principles of international relations  including respect   for sovereignty  territorial integrity and international law.   In addition to the existential threat Russian aggression poses to Ukraine and its people   Russian president Putin’s war on Ukraine risks setting a broader post-Cold-War   precedent that borders can be redrawn through violence.  Northerners understand how close a neighbour Russia is. Canada must be clear-eyed  about the implications of its geographic proximity to Russia. Canadian Forces Station  Alert  on Ellesmere Island  Nunavut  is closer to the Russian military’s air force base   at Nagurskoye  Russia  than Iqaluit is to Ottawa or Toronto is to Winnipeg.   For over a decade  Russia has invested in modernizing its Arctic infrastructure and its  military capabilities in the Arctic to develop resources and control access to the region   with particular emphasis on its own western region and approaches. It is looking to  profit from climate change in the region and will continue promoting the development  of the Northern Sea Route as a major international shipping route. Given the strategic  importance Russia places on its Arctic region  Canada expects these activities   will continue.  Russia has also intensified its disinformation campaigns  conducted below-threshold  military activities3  and crafted a vehement domestic narrative of a “hostile  unfriendly  West ” in part to justify its own militarization of the Arctic.   Russia’s historic posture has been to ensure sovereignty and control over its own Arctic  region and to limit the role of non-Arctic states in Arctic affairs. However  because of  sanctions and of its massive expenditures on its illegal war against Ukraine  Russia  is increasingly reliant on China to fund and support the development of its projects  in the Arctic. These include investments in Arctic research  oil and gas development   ports and other critical infrastructure. We anticipate this trend will continue and lead to  increased activity by China in the Russian Arctic.   Russia and China are aligned in their desire to undermine the liberal-rules-based  international system  but the power asymmetry between them often highlights the  divergence in their interests. Russia is increasingly dependent on China and is reversing  its historic posture by opening its Arctic to China. For instance  in July 2024  Russia and  China  building on their 2022 statement to cooperate in the Arctic  conducted joint  military exercises in the Russian High North. In addition  Russian and Chinese warships  have conducted joint patrols in international waters off the Aleutian Islands; the   2 countries’ coast guards have conducted joint patrols into the Bering Sea; and Russian  and Chinese military aircraft have been detected  tracked and intercepted by the North  American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) while flying in Alaska’s Air Defense  Identification Zone. This demonstrates the continued deepening of Chinese-Russian  military cooperation  particularly in the North Pacific approaches to the Arctic.  3\\t\\t“Below-threshold\\tconflict ”\\talso\\tknown\\tas\\t“grey\\tzone\\tconflict ”\\trefers\\tto\\tcompetitive\\tinteraction\\tbetween\\tstates\\tthat\\tfalls\\t  \\t short\\tof\\ttraditional\\tarmed\\tconflict\\tbut\\tgoes\\tbeyond\\tnormal\\tpeaceful\\trelations.\\tSuch\\tconflict\\tinvolves\\tactions\\tthat\\tare\\t  \\t coercive\\tand\\taggressive\\tbut\\tdeliberately\\tdesigned\\tto\\tremain\\tbelow\\tthe\\tthreshold\\tof\\tarmed\\tconflict.\\tThese\\tactions\\t  \\t could\\tinclude:\\tinformation\\twarfare\\tand\\tpropaganda;\\tcyber\\tattacks\\tand\\tespionage;\\teconomic\\tcoercion;\\tpolitical\\t  \\t interference\\tand\\telection\\tmeddling;\\tthe\\tuse\\tof\\tproxy\\tforces\\tor\\tparamilitary\\tgroups;\\tor\\t“lawfare”\\tand\\t  \\t exploiting\\tlegal\\tambiguities.  7  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Evolving    security    threats across    the Arctic  8  The Arctic is a strategically important region for the defence of North America and the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO’s) northern and western flanks. However    the defence architecture and threat picture differ across the circumpolar north.   The safety  security and defence of the Canadian Arctic comprise a fundamental  priority for the Government of Canada and are critical to the collective defence of North  America. The Arctic regions of North America are protected by the armed forces of  Canada and the United States  individually and bilaterally  and through NORAD    which is binational.  While the risk of military attack in the North American Arctic remains low  the region  represents a geographic vector for traditional and emerging weapons systems  that threaten broader North American and transatlantic security. Canada is seeing  a number of potential threats  including increased Russian activity in Canadian air  approaches  China’s regular deployment of dual-use—having both research and  military application—research vessels and surveillance platforms to collect data  and a  general increase in Arctic maritime activity. Adversaries and competitors also employ  disinformation and influence campaigns  malicious cyber operations and espionage  and foreign interference activities to target Canadians  including northerners.  Close partnership with the United States is essential to the maintenance of a secure   strong and well-defended North American homeland  on which the 2 countries’ mutual  prosperity depends. It is critical in deterring and defending against increasingly sophis- ticated threats to North America  including in the Arctic and its approaches in the North  Atlantic and North Pacific. We expect Canada–United States defence cooperation in  the Arctic to continue to grow  as it is fundamental to both countries’ national   security interests.  Strong and resilient Arctic and northern communities increase Canada’s defence  against threats. With increased tension and with competitors looking to exploit  vulnerabilities in the Canadian North  Canada must take action to build trust in public  institutions and deepen ties with like-minded states. Canada’s diplomacy and defence  and security policies must work hand in hand to keep these emerging threats in check.  The security of the European High North is also of critical importance to Canada’s  security and economic well-being.  The European High North is a contested region militarily  including threats to critical  infrastructure  maritime security  and safety  as well as access concerns. Russia has  established a strong military presence in the Arctic  including with air and naval   platforms equipped with missile systems capable of striking Europe and North   America and of disrupting Canada’s ability to project forces in support of allies and  partners. Russia’s below-threshold actions  military activities and continued weapons  testing in the European High North and the Arctic are deeply troubling.  NATO has strengthened its deterrence and defence posture  including in the European  High North  in response to the increased threat posed by Russia. The accessions of  Finland and Sweden to NATO  in 2023 and 2024 respectively  reinforced the Alliance by  bringing  among other things  their significant cold-weather experience and capabilities  to NATO  thereby bolstering its strategic posture in the European High North. Canada  was the first country to ratify each of their accessions. Canada will continue to share  information on threats in the Arctic with allies and to support NATO operations and  presence in the European High North.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Despite the changing threat picture  it is not in Canada’s strategic interest that the Arctic  becomes a theatre of military conflict. Canada will continue working with territorial   and provincial governments  Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples and allies and   partners throughout the Arctic region to enhance domain awareness  improve   information sharing and strengthen interoperability and research security.  Canada must also take action to mitigate the impact that current and emerging  defence and security threats to the Arctic have on the people who live in the region  and who now find themselves at the frontlines of geopolitical competition.

Adapting    to new    dynamics    for Arctic   governance  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has had cascading impacts on the governance of the  Arctic. While Arctic states continue to fulfill the important responsibility of governing  the Arctic region at a time of unprecedented change  like-minded countries are taking  coordinated action to ensure it is not business as usual with Russia.  The Arctic Council is the pre-eminent forum for international Arctic cooperation   and governance. It brings together the 8 Arctic states  the 6 Permanent Participant   organizations representing Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic  and observers to address   sustainable development and the environmental protection of the Arctic. The role  of Arctic Indigenous Peoples  from the foundation of the Arctic Council in 1996 to  the present  is one of the council’s greatest strengths and is unique in multilateral  governance. The council sets the bar for meaningful Indigenous engagement  which  continues to grow to this day. Arctic governance must be done with those who have  lived in the Arctic for thousands of years  recognizing the strength of shared knowledge  and decision making.   Meetings with all members of the council at the ministerial and Senior Arctic Official   levels remain on hold. Arctic states and Permanent Participants are working at the  expert and scientific level to advance important projects on climate change and  biodiversity  emergency prevention and preparedness and sustainable development.  These projects  along with the other work of the Arctic Council  are helping to drive  meaningful change for people who live across the Arctic. This unique work  done in  collaboration between the Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic and the Arctic states    is what makes the Arctic Council so valuable.  To ensure the maintenance of robust governance in the Arctic—governance that is  capable of tackling the increasing challenges and opportunities the region is facing— cooperation must continue at the Arctic Council. Canada must also identify new forums  and leverage existing ones in new ways to advance discussions on Arctic issues. Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples must be active partners in the conduct of   international relations in the Arctic.   Arctic states also meet in other regional and international forums that contribute to  upholding the rules-based international order  including the Arctic Coast Guard Forum  and the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement. The latter came into force in 2021   establishing a precautionary 16-year ban on commercial fishing on the high seas of   the Arctic Ocean.  Arctic states also play a leading role in advancing Arctic interests in broader global  efforts through the UN system  such as the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s)  ban on heavy fuel oil in the Arctic.  An extensive international legal framework applies to the Arctic Ocean. The law of  the sea  including as set out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)   determines states’ jurisdictions and their rights and obligations in various maritime  zones. These rules apply to the delineation of the outer limits of continental shelves   navigation  the management of natural resources  the protection of the marine environ- ment and other uses of the sea. Consistent with the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration4  Canada  remains committed to the orderly settlement of Arctic disputes in accordance with  international law and expects the same of other signatories  including Russia.  4\\t\\tThe\\tIlulissat\\tDeclaration\\twas\\tsigned\\tby\\tthe\\t5\\tArctic\\tOcean\\tcoastal\\tstates\\t(Canada \\tthe\\tUnited\\tStates \\tthe\\tKingdom\\tof\\t  \\t Denmark \\tNorway\\tand\\tRussia)\\tat\\tIlulissat \\tGreenland \\tin\\tMay\\t2008.\\tIn\\tthe\\tdeclaration \\tthe\\t5\\tstates\\tpledged\\tto\\tenhance\\t  \\t their\\tscientific\\tand\\tenvironmental\\tcooperation\\tin\\tthe\\tArctic\\tOcean.\\tThey\\talso\\tcommitted\\tto\\tthe\\torderly\\tsettlement\\tof\\t  \\t overlaps\\tin\\ttheir\\trespective\\textended\\tcontinental\\tshelves \\tin\\taccordance\\twith\\tinternational\\tlaw.  11  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Canada has a clear interest in maintaining the structures of governance in   the Arctic that ensure Canada’s central role in guiding the region’s future.   Canada especially values the Arctic Council because it provides a platform   for Indigenous Peoples to help shape circumpolar affairs. Canada will not   allow Russia to undermine  through its actions  the pillars of international   cooperation in the Arctic.

Climate     change: the    overarching    threat  Climate change is both the most pressing and the most proximate threat to Canada’s  security in the Arctic and the people who live there. Its causes and effects are not  bound by countries’ official borders.  Climate change is progressing at an alarming pace  with the Arctic warming 4 times  faster than the global average  causing significant impacts on natural and human   environments. These impacts serve as threat multipliers because changing environ- mental conditions create additional opportunities for foreign adversaries and   competitors to covertly or overtly operate in the Canadian Arctic.  The total surface area of Arctic Ocean ice is shrinking  with varied implications for  maritime shipping  trade and resource extraction across the Arctic. Maritime traffic in  the Arctic will continue to increase  which will drive further foreign interest in the region.  This includes maritime traffic in Canada’s Arctic Archipelago  despite the risks and  hazards associated with the unpredictable ice conditions.  With retreating sea ice and new technologies improving navigation and accessibility   foreign activity in the Arctic will continue to increase  bringing with it related safety   security and environmental challenges. With other Arctic states  Canada must be  prepared to respond.  Climate change is also driving an increase in climate-related emergencies and   disrupting ecosystems that Arctic communities rely on for their livelihoods  with   significant implications for the security of northerners  including Indigenous Peoples   who are disproportionately affected by these changes.  Northerners  including Indigenous Peoples  have shared concerns about climate  change and their ongoing efforts to improve their resiliency in the face of increased  pressures on communities and livelihoods  food security and the destabilization of  critical and civilian infrastructure. The disappearance of year-round ice cover and  changes in the timing and durability of the floe edge; increasing subsidence due to  permafrost thaw; and a greater frequency and severity of wildfires are examples of the  impacts of climate change on Arctic communities  all of which have both material and  psychological impacts.  For instance  communities in the North are often impacted by major wildfires. In 2023   more than half of the population of the Northwest Territories had to be evacuated.   There is an ongoing need to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change in the  Arctic to reduce vulnerabilities. Canada must support Arctic and northern Indigenous  Peoples and other northerners in adapting to the environment as it is and will be—not  as one wishes it would be.   In parallel  climate change is driving interest in the Arctic as a sustainable and reliable  source of critical minerals  such as lithium  graphite  nickel  cobalt  copper and rare  earth elements integral to the transition to a low-carbon economy. For Canada and  its allies  the Arctic’s resource potential provides an opportunity to diversify critical  mineral production in partnership with territorial and provincial governments  Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples and local communities. This must be done carefully   respecting the livelihoods of local communities.   Climate change is a global problem; it requires global solutions and multilateral collaboration.  13  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 5.  Increasing     challenges to    Arctic states’    primacy  Canada’s approach to the Arctic is guided by the fundamental principle that the Arctic  should be governed by the Arctic states in collaboration with Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples. As in other regions  strategic competition in the Arctic is growing   with non-Arctic states and actors increasingly expressing foreign policy or security  aspirations  thereby pushing for greater roles in Arctic affairs.  Since 2019  there has been a growing narrative among some non-Arctic states that  they should have a greater say in Arctic governance. China  in particular  has expressed  an ambition to become a “polar great power ” by 2030.  Among China’s priorities in the Arctic are developing commercial shipping opportuni- ties  including a “Polar Silk Road ” as well as natural resource exploitation  including of  critical minerals  oil and gas and fish. China is also active in Arctic research  much   of which can be considered dual use.  China seeks to shape the international order into a more permissive environment for  interests and values that increasingly deviate from Canada’s commitment to a rules- based international system. China can be expected to use all the tools at its disposal   to advance its geopolitical interests  including in the Arctic. Canada will challenge China  when it ought to and cooperate when its interests align with China’s.  China  like all states  has rights and responsibilities related to its use of the world’s  oceans that apply equally in the Arctic. For example  in accordance with UNCLOS   China can only conduct marine scientific research in the exclusive economic zone  of another state with the consent of that state. Canada will carefully review any such  requests related to its own exclusive economic zone and provide or withhold consent  consistent with the provisions of the convention.  14  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   Photo Credit: © Global Affairs  Canada  Consistent with its Indo-Pacific Strategy and in collaboration with partners  Canada will  always act on matters of Arctic governance to protect national and northern interests   including when dealing with China. Canada will cooperate with China to address   pressing global issues—such as climate change—that have impacts on the Arctic.  In the Canadian Arctic  Canada will always work to protect Canada’s economic security   safeguard Canadian values and protect Canadians from malign influence.  Canada will continue to work closely with the United States to counter all forms   of malign influence and activity in the North American Arctic.   In the wider region  Canada will always uphold the founding principles that under- pinned the Ottawa Declaration in 1996 on the establishment of the Arctic Council.  These include Canada’s commitment to the well-being of the inhabitants of the Arctic;  its commitment to sustainable development in the Arctic region  including economic  and social development  improved health conditions and cultural well-being; its   commitment to the protection of the Arctic environment; and its commitment to  ensure full consultation with  and the involvement of  Indigenous Peoples and their   communities and other inhabitants of the Arctic on Arctic Council activities.  At all times  Canada’s engagement in the Arctic will be focused first and foremost on  promoting and defending Canadian national interests. Canada will adopt a pragmatic  approach when circumstances require it.  15  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ARCTIC FOREIGN  POLICY PILLARS  The Arctic Foreign Policy provides Global Affairs Canada  with additional diplomatic tools to support a stable   prosperous and secure Arctic and to fully implement   the objectives laid out in the International chapter of   the ANPF given the changing geopolitical context.  We will do this by continuing to assert Canada’s   sovereignty; advancing Canada’s national interests  through pragmatic diplomacy; leading on Arctic   governance and multilateral challenges; and adopting   a more inclusive approach to Arctic diplomacy.

Leveraging diplomacy to support national defence and security  The Government of Canada will continue to take a   comprehensive approach to Arctic security by prioritizing  the security  interests and priorities of the Arctic region  and northerners  as well as Canadians more broadly.  Canada’s foreign and defence policies are closely  intertwined and complementary. Effective diplomacy  is critical for shaping the international environment to  defend and advance Canadian national interests; it is   a first line of defence for Canada’s national security.   Canada’s fundamental defence and security goal is   to prevent and defuse potential crises before they can  develop into conflict.  Canada’s national security is also supported by human  security. Strong and resilient local communities are vital  to national defence.  Canada engages in the Arctic from a position of strength  thanks to the Canadian Armed Forces’ (CAF’s) presence  and capabilities  exercises and operations  including  those of the Canadian Rangers. Canadian Rangers are  active  well-respected members of their communities   and they play a critical role in demonstrating Canadian  sovereignty over the lands  waters and ice of Canada’s  North and Arctic.  Building on the NORAD modernization investments  announced in 2022  Canada’s defence policy update  Our North  Strong and Free identified the Government of  Canada’s most pressing priority as the continued asser- tion of Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and northern  regions. Canada is making investments to ensure that  the CAF has the capabilities required to operate in an  evolving geopolitical context. By 2030  Canada will have  almost tripled its defence spending from 2015.  Strengthened military capabilities will bolster the CAF’s  ability to conduct and sustain operations in the Arctic  and create opportunities for strengthened collaboration  with allies and partners. Canada regularly invites select  allies and partners to take part in Operation NANOOK   the CAF’s signature northern operation series. Canada  also works with allies and partners on multinational  research and development activities relevant to the  conduct of defence and security operations in   the polar regions.   In addition to NORAD modernization and the defence  policy update  Canada is pursuing historic investments  to increase its military capability in the maritime domain  in the Arctic. Ensuring that Canada’s internal waters in  the Arctic are well defended is a critical component of  maintaining a secure North American homeland. Canada  will maintain strong defence capabilities in its internal  Arctic waters  including in the Northwest Passage.   17  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Here is a summary of key defence   and security investments:    Several military capabilities will play a key role in   exercising Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic and  northern waters  including Canada’s 6 new Arctic  Offshore Patrol Ships; up to 15 new River Class  Destroyers; 11 new MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones;   up to 16 new P-8A Poseidon multi-mission aircraft  specialized in anti-submarine and anti-surface  warfare; and 88 new F-35A fighter aircraft.     Canada’s $38.6 billion plan to modernize NORAD will  significantly enhance domain awareness in the Arctic  and the North through the establishment of a   new northern approaches surveillance system to   complement the North Warning System and further   investment in space-based surveillance. It also  includes further investment in space-based polar  communications; additional air-to-air refuelling aircraft  to support and extend the reach of CAF operations— and NORAD operations—in Canada; additional and  longer-range air-to-air missiles for Canada’s fighter  fleet; significant infrastructure upgrades at airfields  used to support NORAD forward operations; and   more than $4 billion in new funding for science   and technology.    The defence policy update announced an additional  $8.1 billion in spending over the next 5 years and   $73 billion over the next 20 years to support   Canada’s national defence and security in the Arctic.  This includes a new fleet of airborne early warning  and control aircraft; specialized maritime sensors   including some that can be deployed by Harry  DeWolf-class Arctic Offshore Patrol vessels; a new  fleet of tactical helicopters; and a new satellite  ground station in the Arctic to enhance the use of  Canadian  U.S. and other Allied space capabilities.     The defence policy update will also establish a new  network of Northern Operational Support Hubs to  further enhance the CAF’s presence  responsiveness  and partnerships across the Arctic and the North  and invest in multi-use infrastructure that also meets  the needs of the territories  Indigenous Peoples and  northern communities.    In July 2024  Canada announced it would initiate new  spending programs to put the country on track to  reach NATO’s target of 2% of GDP spending by 2032.  This will include the purchase of up to 12 convention- ally powered  under-ice-capable submarines by the  Royal Canadian Navy.    In 2024  the Government of Canada initiated the   procurement of 8 new icebreakers made in Canada  to support Canadian Coast Guard operations in the  Arctic  including 2 polar icebreakers that will enable  year-round icebreaker presence in the Arctic. The  icebreakers will contribute to the protection of the  marine environment  the resupplying of communities  and the collection of data that enhances Canada’s  maritime domain awareness in support of maritime  safety and security  climate resilience and   scientific research.    In July 2024  Canada  the United States and Finland   announced an enhanced trilateral partnership called  the ICE Pact. It is a collaborative effort to build best- in-class Arctic and polar icebreakers and other Arctic  and polar capabilities in each of the countries by  sharing expertise  information and capabilities. This  partnership also bolsters the ability of like-minded  nations to uphold international rules  norms and  standards to ensure safety and to sustain peace and  stability in the Arctic.  The diplomatic initiatives in the Arctic Foreign Policy will  complement all of these investments by better aligning  Canada’s strategic approaches and by strengthening  its relationships with its Arctic allies  with territorial and  provincial governments and with Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners.  18  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy i.  Bridging the intelligence gap  To address the complex range of threats faced in the  Arctic  Canada must conceptualize security not only in  military terms. Security in the Arctic includes community  security  research security  economic security  security  against disinformation and any other form of interference  and physical and digital infrastructure security.  We will work with Public Safety Canada to support efforts  to strengthen Canadian national resilience to counter  malign influence and activities of foreign powers. Canada  will strengthen the defence of its critical infrastructure  across the country  including in the Arctic  to protect  northern communities against foreign interference. This  can be achieved through the Investment Canada Act;  by strengthening Canadian cyber security systems; and  through new legislation to address foreign interference.  We will provide relevant territorial   provincial and Indigenous  governments with regular briefings  and information on emerging and  developing international security  trends  including threats affecting the  Arctic  to ensure that they are equipped  to support communities in Canada’s  Arctic and North and to make informed  decisions about the security of their  communities.  This will be achieved in collaboration  with the Canadian Security Intelligence  Service  the Communications Security  Establishment  the Department of  National Defence and Public   Safety Canada.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  19  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Canada will support territorial  provincial  and Indigenous authorities in taking into  account a national security lens to foreign  research in Canada’s Arctic.   Global Affairs Canada will support the  work of Innovation  Science and Economic  Development Canada  Crown-Indigenous  Relations and Northern Affairs and its  portfolio agencies  the Department of  National Defence  Natural Resources  Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada   among others  to support the scientific  research permitting process in the Arctic   particularly for international applicants  undertaking research that can be  considered dual use.  To help ensure emerging challenges  concerning research security and science  collaboration in the North are addressed    we will help by increasing our capacity  to learn about concerns from those on  the ground  holding annual round-table  meetings on science and research relating  to Canada’s Arctic foreign policy priorities.  We will work closely with other federal  government departments and agencies   to organize the round-table meetings.  The Arctic ambassador (see Pillar 4 -  Adopting a more inclusive approach to  Arctic diplomacy) will work with Indigenous  Peoples and partners from territorial and  provincial governments  as well as across  the Government of Canada  to contribute  to the efforts to address climate change   biodiversity and other areas where  Indigenous Knowledge  science and  technologies could contribute solutions   to the challenges in the Arctic.  The Arctic ambassador will also work with  Canada’s Chief Science Advisor on issues  related to science and research.  20  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  ii.  Strengthening research security  International scientific collaboration plays an important  role in addressing gaps in knowledge of the Arctic  region  including in relation to climate change. The last  20 years have seen a marked increase in international  research activity across the Canadian and   circumpolar Arctic.   While Canada continues to welcome scientific   collaboration in the Arctic  Canada’s oversight  regu- latory  safety and security bodies must be equipped  to address potential threats and harms at all levels. In  particular  Canada must guard against foreign research  in the Canadian Arctic and North that is dual use—having  both research and military application.   This requires balancing between the important priority  of advancing recognized areas of needed international  scientific collaboration  such as climate change research   with necessary due diligence to protect Canada’s most  sensitive research.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy iii. Partnering with the Canadian Coast Guard      to support defence and security  The Canadian Coast Guard  alongside other partner  departments and agencies  is responsible for maritime  domain awareness and plays a critical role in supporting  the defence and security of the North.  Building on the Canadian Coast Guard Arctic Strategy   released in 2024  the Canadian Coast Guard will continue  to contribute to Canada’s national security  including  through its assistance to Arctic scientific   research expeditions.  The Canadian Coast Guard currently operates up to   6 icebreakers in the Arctic from June to November each  year  which helps advance maritime safety and security.  In the coming years  the Canadian Coast Guard will  acquire 8 new icebreakers  including 2 polar icebreakers  that will provide capacity for year-round presence   in the Arctic.  The Canadian Coast Guard also helps to deepen  Canadian defence cooperation with Arctic allies through  Operation Pacer Goose. The annual operation resupplies  the United States’ Pituffik Space Base (formerly known  as Thule Air Base) in Greenland  ensuring that essential  supplies are safely delivered in challenging   Arctic conditions.  To strengthen the interconnections  between the Arctic Foreign Policy  and the Canadian Coast Guard Arctic  Strategy  we will collaborate more  closely with the Canadian Coast  Guard to leverage its maritime  domain expertise and support its  work with international partners.  Through its operations and activities   the Canadian Coast Guard helps  contribute to stronger relationships with  Canada’s Arctic allies. Through deeper  collaboration  the Canadian Coast  Guard will also be able to expand its  partnerships with regional coast guards  from like-minded states.   21  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy iv. Strengthening regional defence      and security architectures  To respond to the evolving threat landscape in the Arctic   Canada will strengthen coordination and dialogue with  Arctic allies on security issues.  Alongside the Department of National Defence  we  will increase our information sharing with NATO on  circumpolar threats. We will improve interoperability and  increase the collective understanding of the evolving  security situation in the Arctic and enhance the Alliance’s  cold-weather capabilities. Canada will continue to be  an active participant in NATO exercises and operations   including in the European High North.  To ensure seamless situational awareness and informa- tion sharing on northern threats that do not recognize  borders or military command areas of responsibility   Canada supports greater coordination and collaboration  between the military forces of like-minded Arctic states   including in the context of NATO and NORAD activities.  Canada will explore and foster new partnerships to  strengthen the strategic resilience of the North American  Arctic  particularly with Alaska  the Yukon  the Northwest  Territories  Nunavut and Greenland.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  To complement existing defence forums  Canada is exploring opportunities to deepen  security dialogue among all like-minded states in the Arctic  including through regular  security discussions.    Canada will initiate an Arctic security dialogue with the ministers of foreign affairs of  like-minded states in the Arctic. Discussions will focus on sharing information on  and  on analyses of  issues relating to international Arctic relations and security; as well  as discussing national approaches to cross-cutting security challenges; advancing  opportunities for collaboration; and increasing collective resilience.  22  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Upholding the rules-based international order  The waters of Canada’s Arctic Archipelago  including   the various channels comprising the Northwest Passage   are internal waters of Canada by virtue of historic title  and in accordance with international law. Canada’s Arctic  sovereignty encompasses land  sea and ice. It extends  without interruption to the seaward-facing coasts of the  Arctic islands and beyond. These islands are joined  not  divided  by the waters between them and are bridged for  a large part of the year by ice.  Indigenous Peoples in Canada have used and occupied  the ice and waters as they have used and occupied  the lands for thousands of years. Every day  through a  wide range of activities  Arctic and northern Indigenous  Peoples and governments  as well as territorial and  provincial governments and other northerners  share  stewardship over the Arctic lands and waters of Canada.  It is through the reciprocal recognition of each other’s  mutual interests in these lands and waters that Canada  and Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples share in the  stewardship of them—further codified in modern treaties  and self-government agreements. Sovereignty and   sovereign rights in the Arctic are inextricably linked   to issues of Indigenous self-government. Canada   possesses environmental  economic  cultural and   historical interests unique to the region  the reality  and importance of which are clearly evidenced by  long-standing usage.  Canada will work with Arctic and  northern Indigenous partners to assert  shared interests and priorities in the  region  such as through partnerships  with the Inuit Marine Monitoring  Program and the Indigenous  Guardians program.5 These initiatives  provide Indigenous Peoples with  greater opportunities to exercise  responsibility for the stewardship of  their traditional lands  waters and ice.  Canada intends to continue to act as a responsible  sovereign of its Arctic territories and waters  relying on  the rules-based international order and supported by  historical and scientific evidence. Canada’s commitment  to ensuring that maritime claims are addressed in a  manner that is consistent with international law is one   of its key enduring priorities in the Arctic.

Managing Arctic boundaries through    a rules-based approach  At a time when the rules-based international order   is under unprecedented threat  it is critical that states  resolve their disputes responsibly  through dialogue  and negotiation. Canada has made resolving boundary  disputes in accordance with international law one of the  foundational principles of its foreign policy in the Arctic.  Enhanced international cooperation on maritime  boundaries also helps secure states’ respective national  interests over their resources  including energy  minerals   fish and wildlife.  Canada will advance efforts to resolve  Arctic boundary disputes peacefully  and in accordance with international  law  including UNCLOS  and in  consultation with Indigenous partners   particularly where these international  boundaries may affect treaty rights.  Canada–Kingdom of Denmark  boundary agreement  Canada  the Kingdom of Denmark  and  Greenland have resolved the maritime  boundary and long-time dispute over  Tartupaluk. In June 2022  following  5 years of intensive negotiations   the Canadian  Nunavut  Danish and  Greenlandic governments agreed  on a modernized single maritime  boundary  from the Lincoln Sea in  the north to the Labrador Sea in  the south—a distance of over 3 000  kilometres—which established the  longest bilateral maritime boundary  in the world. The agreement also  resolved the overlap in our respective  continental shelves in the Labrador Sea.  With the Kingdom of Denmark   Canada agreed to divide the island  of Tartupaluk roughly in half; Canada  is now advancing discussions on an  agreed border regime for Tartupaluk   which requires engagement with the  Government of Nunavut and local  Inuit communities. This is the last step  before the agreement can come into  force  which Canada is committed to  completing in the near future.  24  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Extended continental shelf  Canada–United States   Beaufort Sea boundary  In September 2024  Canada launched  negotiations with the United States to  resolve the 2 countries’ long-standing  maritime boundary dispute in the  Beaufort Sea. The area in question  is north of the Yukon and Alaska and  measures approximately 270 000  square kilometres. Both countries claim  jurisdiction over the disputed region  by way of differing legal interpretations  of the 1825 treaty between Russia and  Great Britain.  Reflecting the Government of Canada’s  commitment to partnership and  reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples   the boundary negotiations will involve  impacted Inuit Treaty Organizations and  close consultations with territorial and  Indigenous governments.   In December 2022  Canada filed  an addendum to its Arctic Ocean  extended continental shelf  submission with the Commission on  the Limits of the Continental Shelf  in response to Russia’s addendum   which was filed in March 2021. Russia’s  addendum greatly expanded the size  of the continental shelf included in its  submission and tripled the area that  overlaps with Canada’s own continental  shelf. Canada’s 2022 addendum  rebalanced the overlap area.  In December 2023  the United  States published the outer limits  of its extended continental shelf  in the western Arctic Ocean. This  announcement offers an opportunity  for Canada to renew negotiations  with the United States regarding the  overlap of the countries’ respective  continental shelves. These discussions  are expected to begin in late 2024.  Canada  like all Arctic Ocean coastal  states  remains committed to settling  continental shelf overlap areas  peacefully and in accordance   with international law.  25  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Advancing Canada’s interests   through pragmatic diplomacy  A fundamental principle of Canadian foreign policy is that the Arctic   should be governed by the Arctic states. This has long been a shared   principle of the Arctic states and has produced a long period    of peaceful cooperation and development in the region.   1. Strengthening Canada’s partnerships with Arctic allies  i.  The United States   The United States is Canada’s closest partner and ally   in the Arctic  and this collaboration extends across many  shared interests. Collaboration is advanced by Canada’s  extensive diplomatic network of 13 missions across the  United States and through various bilateral mechanisms.  With the United States  Canada shares a unique   relationship shaped by geography  history  shared values   common interests and strong people-to-people connec- tions. This is especially the case in the Arctic  particularly  among Indigenous Peoples  whose history  culture and  connections transcend national borders.   The Canada–United States defence partnership is  essential to maintaining a secure North American   homeland. Canada welcomes the continued partici- pation of the United States’ military and coast guard in  Canada-led exercises and operations in Canada’s   Arctic and North.  Going forward  Canada will continue to advance bilateral cooperation with the United  States in the North at all levels of government in existing areas of importance and explore  new avenues of cooperation in critical areas of national interest  including: security and  safety; the defence of North America; science and research technology; energy security;  supply chains; climate change; critical minerals; sustainable development; Indigenous  cross-border mobility; economic development; marine and terrestrial conservation; and the  protection of transboundary species  including salmon and the Porcupine caribou herd.  26  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii.   The Nordic states  Canada maintains close relations with its Nordic Arctic  neighbours; specifically  the Kingdom of Denmark  (consisting of Denmark  Greenland and the Faroe  Islands)  Finland  Iceland  Norway and Sweden. These  close relationships are underpinned by shared values   a common outlook on the world and a shared commit- ment to ensuring a peaceful and stable Arctic through  the enduring success of NATO. They continue to grow  stronger  with a particularly marked increase in dialogue  and cooperation since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now  more than ever  it is critical for Canada to have strong  partnerships with the Nordic states  as Canada and they  are all now members of NATO and Russia’s actions have  complicated cooperation in multilateral spaces of Arctic  governance. Examples of Canada’s close relationships  with its Nordic Arctic neighbours include the following:    In 2022  Canada was the first country to ratify    the accessions of Finland and Sweden to NATO.    In June 2023  Canada’s prime minister was the  invited guest at the Nordic prime ministers’   annual meeting  in Iceland.    In June 2024  the Government of Canada committed  up to $20 million in funding for an international  research initiative on the sustainable development  of the Arctic in collaboration with NordForsk  an   organization under the Nordic Council of Ministers.  It will support collaborative and multi-disciplinary  scientific efforts and contributions from across the  Arctic region and include Indigenous perspectives.    In September 2024  Canada’s minister of foreign affairs  and the premier of Nunavut co-hosted representa- tives from the Kingdom of Denmark  Finland  Iceland   Norway and Sweden for the first Canada-Nordic  Strategic Dialogue  in Iqaluit  Nunavut.    Canada is committed to deepening its partnership  with the Nordic countries as friends and allies with  common values and shared stewardship over the Arctic.  Strengthening Canada’s cooperation will also help it  respond to new threats and below-threshold activities by  its adversaries in both the North American Arctic and the  European High North.   Working in collaboration with other  federal departments  we will increase  our support for bilateral and regional  cooperation with the Kingdom of  Denmark  Finland  Iceland  Norway  and Sweden in Arctic science and  technology  climate change  culture   Indigenous-to-Indigenous ties  natural  resources  sustainable development  through trade and infrastructure and  defence and security.  We will also create a new position  in one of Canada’s Nordic missions  with responsibility for increasing  coordination and information sharing   including on security issues    with Nordic partners.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  27  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy To do this  we will open new consulates in Anchorage   Alaska  and Nuuk  Greenland.  Alaska is a key partner on a range of issues  including  border security and crossings  security and defence in  the Arctic  climate resilience and conservation  energy  security  critical minerals and Indigenous affairs.   Members of the CAF are stationed in Alaska to support  the NORAD mission and work alongside their U.S. military  counterparts in the defence of North America.  In addition  the Yukon also has mature and close-knit  bilateral relations with Alaska from both a political and  trade perspective.   iii. The North American Arctic: Alaska and Greenland  The North American Arctic encompasses the vast   northern territories of 3 countries: Alaska (the United  States) in the west; northern Canada in the centre;   and Greenland (the Kingdom of Denmark) in the east.   The relationships in this region are unique due to   geographical proximity and the ancestral relations   that exist between Indigenous Peoples  which give rise   to a number of shared interests  including on security   defence  climate change  sustainable development   critical minerals  trade  culture and Indigenous mobility.  The ANPF emphasizes increasing cooperation among  federal  territorial  provincial and Indigenous govern- ments and other organizations in and across the   Canadian Arctic and with Canada’s North American   Arctic partners.  The Arctic Foreign Policy complements this by  re-emphasizing the importance of deepening Canada’s  diplomatic engagement with its neighbours  the United  States  including Alaska  and the Kingdom of Denmark   including Greenland. This will make the Canadian and  North American Arctic more secure and create new  opportunities for economic cooperation  scientific   collaboration and cultural exchange.   The consulate in Anchorage will help promote trade and  economic ties between Canada’s territories and provinces and  Alaska; improve security and defence partnerships; strengthen  collaboration on environmental and wildlife issues; engage with  Alaskan communities  including Indigenous communities; and  support cross-border people-to-people ties.   28  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Many ties  both formal and informal  have been forged  over the years at all levels of government and between  Inuit organizations in Canada and Greenland. Several  bilateral initiatives have been advanced in recent years   including the Letter of Intent for Cooperation on the  Pikialasorsuaq (2023) and the Memorandum of Under- standing between the Government of Greenland and the  Government of Nunavut (2022). However  cooperation to  date has largely occurred organically  without an   overarching foreign policy framework.  In recognition of the growing importance of Greenland   as a key Arctic partner  a more coordinated approach  with Greenland  including with the government of   Nunavut  is a priority in ensuring that Canadian   interests are being advanced effectively.  The consulate in Nuuk will be a  valuable resource for coordinating  and advancing Canadian interests in  Greenland  enhancing bilateral and  commercial relations  facilitating  research collaboration and supporting  increased engagement and  collaboration across many   policy spaces.  We welcome Greenland’s  commitment to open a  representational office in Canada.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  29  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Holding    Russia    accountable  Russia represents a generational geopolitical challenge.  Although Russia accounts for 50% of the Arctic   geographically  bilateral cooperation between Canada  and Russia  including in the Arctic  will remain   exceedingly difficult for the foreseeable future.  Canada will continue to hold Russia accountable in regional  and multilateral forums for its actions and counter disinformation  promoted by the Russian regime  including through Canada’s  leadership of the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism. This includes  countering disinformation targeting communities   in the Canadian Arctic.   Alongside allies and partners  Canada will continue confronting  Russian aggression  including through Canada’s enduring   support for Ukraine  and by continuing to meet NATO   defence commitments.  Together with the United States  Canada will defend NATO’s  western flank  and with Arctic allies  Canada will defend NATO’s  northern regions and approaches.  Canada acknowledges that the actions of the Putin  regime do not always reflect the values of the Russian  people. This policy clearly differentiates between   government actions and those of the broader Russian  population  including its Indigenous Peoples  who them- selves have been marginalized by the Russian regime.  Across all multilateral bodies  Canada will maintain its  policy of limited engagement with Russian officials.  It is for Russia to create the conditions that will enable  a return to political engagement and cooperation by  ending its war in Ukraine and acting in accordance   with international law.  30  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   3.  Pragmatic    diplomacy    with non-    Arctic states    and actors  While Canada will continue to prioritize cooperation   with Arctic states  especially when it comes to setting  the rules that govern the region  cooperation with a  wider set of actors is beneficial and necessary to address  challenges to the Arctic emanating from global issues   such as climate change.  Given the prospect of growing competition in the Arctic   Canada will be strategic in prioritizing pragmatic   cooperation with non-Arctic states and actors that   align with Canadian values  interests and objectives.  Canada will be guided by the following principles:   › Respect for Arctic states’ sovereignty  sovereign rights and    jurisdiction in the Arctic.   › Support for the rules-based international order in the Arctic    and a demonstrated commitment to regional peace and stability.   › Respect for Indigenous self-determination  Indigenous rights and the values    interests  cultures and traditions of Arctic Indigenous Peoples  including the   participation of Indigenous Peoples in Arctic decision making  and other   Arctic inhabitants.   › Respect for the extensive legal framework that applies to the Arctic Ocean     including UNCLOS.   › Recognition of interests and expertise that are relevant to  and aligned with     Canada’s Arctic and northern priorities  as well as its national defence   and security interests.   › Maintaining a commitment to uphold and advance democratic values    human rights and gender equality according to international standards    regulations and principles.   › Openness with regard to scientific data sharing and collaboration   with Canadian researchers and local communities  including their   representative governments.   › Commitment to sustainable development  conservation  environmental    protection and fighting climate change.   Engagement with non-Arctic states and actors will be  channeled through a variety of multilateral forums  such  as the Arctic Council  appropriate UN bodies  NATO and  the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable  as well as treaties  that apply to the Arctic  such as the Central Arctic Ocean  Fisheries Agreement  and bilateral and multilateral   platforms and projects that we will drive with other  federal departments and agencies.  Going forward  based on the above principles  Canada  will place particular emphasis on cooperation with  non-Arctic states and actors in 2 regions: the North  Atlantic and the North Pacific.  31  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy The North Atlantic  Canada will strengthen engagement  on Arctic matters with the European  Union  the United Kingdom and other  key North Atlantic states through  established mechanisms  such as the  Canada–European Union Strategic  Partnership Agreement. Science   technology and innovation will remain  the focus of Canada’s cooperation with  the European Union and key European  states through Canada’s engagement  on the European Union–United  States–Canada Arctic Working Group  of the All-Atlantic Ocean Research  and Innovation Alliance; the Canada- European Union Ocean Partnership  Forum; and the Horizon   Europe program.  Other priorities for Arctic cooperation include facilitating  the mobility of Inuit between Canada and Greenland;  facilitating the trade of  and access to  the seal products  of Inuit and other Indigenous Peoples  in the E.U. market;  the conservation of fish stocks through the Canada– European Union High-Level Dialogue on Fisheries;   environmental protection; climate mitigation and   adaptation; trade and sustainable economic   development; security cooperation through   high-level dialogues; and the Canada–European   Union Green Alliance.  The United Kingdom is another close partner in the  North Atlantic based on Canada’s deep partnership   with the country and their historic ties and shared values.  The 2 countries enjoy a close-knit defence partnership   and they cooperate on shared priorities in the Arctic   including on climate change and research through   the Canada–Inuit Nunangat–United Kingdom Arctic   Research Programme.

The strategy recognizes the North Pacific as part of  Canada’s neighbourhood. The North Pacific  through  the Bering Strait  is one of the key approaches to the  North American Arctic. Canada must not undervalue the  strategic importance of these approaches—Canada’s  adversaries do not underestimate them. In line with the  strategy  Canada will explore ways to deepen Arctic  cooperation with key North Pacific states on issues of  mutual interest while also responding to the emerging  challenges some may represent.  While Canada is pleased to engage with Indo-Pacific  states making positive contributions in the Arctic accord- ing to the principles for engagement with non-Arctic  states  Canada will closely scrutinize activities of states  whose ambitions or activities are potentially counter to  Canadian values  interests or objectives in the region.  In addition to Canada’s long-standing partnership with the  United States on Arctic issues  focus will be given to increasing  cooperation with other key partners in the region—Japan and the  Republic of Korea—given the mutual long-standing relationships  and shared values of the 3 nations.  Canada will work through established forums and mechanisms   such as the Arctic Council  the Canada-Japan Action Plan for  Contributing to a Free and Open Indo-Pacific Region and the  Canada-Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership  to identify  concrete opportunities to deepen cooperation between the   4 countries on shared priorities  such as maritime security   science and technology  trade and sustainable economic   development and fisheries.  33  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Leadership on Arctic governance  and multilateral challenges  Despite\\texceedingly\\tdifficult\\trelations\\twith\\tRussia \\tArctic\\tstates\\t  continue to preside over a well-governed region operating under   extensive national and international legal frameworks.

Reinforcing      the Arctic    Council  Canada is firmly committed to the enduring value of the  Arctic Council and is adhering to its established Rules  of Procedure. Canada remains focused on continuing  the council’s important work for the benefit of the Arctic  region and the people living there  including   Indigenous Peoples.    Since 2021  our Global Arctic Leadership Initiative has  funded the establishment of a permanent secretariat  of the Arctic Council’s Sustainable Development   Working Group in Canada and provided over $2 million  in funding for more than 25 Arctic Council initiatives  with national  civil society and Indigenous partners.   The Arctic Council exists thanks in part to Canadian and  Indigenous leadership. Canada will not allow Russia’s  actions to undermine the integrity or functionality of this  important body. The people of the Arctic  who benefit so  deeply from the important work of the council  should  not be made to suffer because of Russia’s choices.     We will increase our contributions to the Arctic Council to allow for more Canadian  engagement and leadership in council projects and greater institutional support for the  council  as well as provide funding for innovative Indigenous and youth ideas in the council.  This support is critically important as the council continues to increase its activities.  Canada will increase its leadership in the council in preparation for Canada’s third chairship  of the Arctic Council  from 2029 to 2031. Working with Canadian and Arctic Council  partners  Canada will meaningfully engage the Permanent Participants from Canada   territorial and provincial governments of Canada and other Indigenous partners on the  planning and development of Canada’s Arctic Council chairship program.   Those essential building blocks will also provide guidance on how Canada engages in  other international polar processes  such as the International Polar Year: 2032 to 2033  which  is an opportunity to showcase Canada’s leadership through scientific and technological  achievements  as well as by amplifying Indigenous Peoples’ voices and   their rich knowledge.  35  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Addressing regional     and global challenges  i.  Climate change and environmental protection  While the triple crisis of climate change  biodiversity   loss and pollution is a global problem that requires  urgent collective action  the impacts of this triple crisis  are disproportionately felt by northerners. Canada has  taken a dual-track approach to addressing these issues   with engagement at the multilateral level through the  UN system and at the regional level through   the Arctic Council.  In addition to robust domestic measures to address  climate change  Canada is also working with international  partners to boost global efforts to achieve the Paris  Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C to avoid   the most devastating impacts for the world    including the Arctic.  Cutting emissions of black carbon is the most powerful  action to take to slow the pace of near-term warming in  the Arctic. For this reason  Arctic states agreed to   collectively reduce emissions of black carbon by 25%   to 33% of 2013 levels by 2025. Canada is on track to do   its part in achieving this collective goal.  Canada is also doing its part to address biodiversity loss  and advance conservation domestically and globally.  Canada continues to work toward conserving 30%   of its lands and oceans by 2030. A large part of   Canada’s protected and conserved areas fall within   Canada’s Arctic and North  and many are being   co-managed with Indigenous Peoples.6   To increase cohesiveness  we will continue to leverage  our diplomatic resources in support of all government  efforts led by Environment and Climate Change  Canada in the UN system to ensure implementation  of the historic Paris Agreement  of the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change  and of the  Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework  under the Convention on Biological Diversity.   Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  6 Final Report of the National Advisory Panel on Marine Protected Area Standards   36  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Canada’s ambassador for climate change will continue to advocate for international  partners to join Canada-led initiatives on phasing out coal; reducing short-lived climate  pollutants; finalizing a global treaty to end plastic pollution; protecting more of nature; and  other related initiatives. The ambassador will also continue to promote any other diplomatic  initiatives that address climate change. The Arctic ambassador will support this work.  Additionally  in the context of the Arctic Council’s initiatives on climate change  Canada will  continue its ongoing work at a regional level to develop scientific assessments on the  impacts of climate change and the state of biodiversity in the Arctic; to reduce short-lived  climate pollutants in the Arctic region; to encourage the use and development of renewable  energy in remote Arctic communities to exchange knowledge and implement solutions  on wildfires and climate change adaptation in an Arctic context; to develop a pan-Arctic  network of marine protected areas; and to implement the regional action plan on marine  litter in the Arctic.  Elsewhere  we will encourage all allies to join NATO’s Climate Change and Security  Centre of Excellence  which is based in Montréal. Working with the Department of  National Defence  we will also leverage the centre’s expertise to promote research and  knowledge sharing on climate security threats in the Arctic and elsewhere.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  37  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii. The Arctic Ocean  Canada’s exclusive economic zone in the Arctic Ocean  comprises more than 3 million square kilometres. This  imposes a responsibility on Canada to ensure that the  area is well managed. Canada is collaborating closely  with fellow Arctic Ocean coastal states and other   interested parties to implement the Central Arctic Ocean  Fisheries Agreement  which established a precautionary  16-year ban on commercial fishing on the high seas of  the Arctic Ocean  as well as a program for joint scientific  research and monitoring that includes Indigenous  Knowledge as a vital component to ensure that the best  available knowledge is used in decision making. Canada  is also ensuring that Inuit in Canada continue to be part  of this process.  Canada is also prioritizing the protection of the marine  environment in the Arctic Ocean in cooperation with  its like-minded international and Indigenous partners.  Canada maintains an indefinite moratorium on offshore  oil and gas development in its Arctic waters. Canada  also supports  in the absence of both a comprehensive  understanding of seabed mining’s environmental  impacts and a robust regulatory regime  a moratorium  on commercial seabed mining in areas beyond national  jurisdiction  including in the central Arctic Ocean.  Canada is committed to reinforcing rules-based  approaches in the Arctic Ocean.  We will work with other departments and agencies   to continue to develop and implement international  measures to promote safe and responsible shipping  in the Arctic  including by supporting efforts at the IMO  and the Arctic Council that complement the International  Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (known as the  “Polar Code”) and the ban on heavy fuel oil   in Arctic waters.    Across all areas of Canada’s multilateral cooperation   in the UN system  at the Arctic Council and under   the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement  it is   imperative that Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples  be meaningfully engaged in discussions when their  rights or interests could be potentially impacted.  We will continue to provide funding  to Indigenous Permanent Participant  organizations in Canada to engage  in this work. We will also advocate   alongside Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples  for the equal  treatment and inclusion of Indigenous  Knowledge and science.  In support of Fisheries and Oceans  Canada  we undertake to advocate  for the development of marine  protected areas and other effective  conservation measures in the central  Arctic Ocean under the Arctic Council   thereby enabling Arctic states to lead  by example in implementing the  UN agreement on marine biological  diversity in areas beyond   national jurisdiction.  38  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Adopting a more inclusive  approach to Arctic diplomacy  1.\\tEnsuring\\tArctic\\tdiplomacy\\tis\\tinformed\\tby\\tand\\tbenefits\\tArctic\\t   and northern Indigenous Peoples and other northerners   The Arctic is home to more than 4 million people   including Indigenous Peoples who have inhabited the  region for thousands of years. Canada is committed to  a more inclusive approach to this foreign policy that  ensures people living in the North  including Indigenous  peoples  can participate in international decision making  on matters that affect their rights or interests.  Arctic diplomacy should be informed by and benefit  Arctic and northern Indigenous Peoples and other  northerners. We remain committed to this goal and  will strengthen our efforts in this area  building on the  approach adopted in the ANPF to remain open to  holding discussions within more appropriate   distinctions-based frameworks  like the Inuit-Crown   Partnership Committee.   To move forward  Canada acknowledges the damaging  impacts of colonialism on the Indigenous Peoples   of Canada’s Arctic and North. Grounded in a commitment  to reconciliation  this policy seeks to build in the Arctic  foreign policy space a renewed Inuit-Crown and   nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous Peoples  based on the recognition of rights  respect  cooperation   and partnership.  Our work on this foreign policy will be guided by the  United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous  Peoples; treaties  including land claims agreements;  self-government agreements with Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples; and the Inuit Nunangat Policy.7  Canada’s Arctic foreign policy will also be guided  by respect for territorial and provincial jurisdiction   including the devolution agreements with the Northwest  Territories  Nunavut and the Yukon.  7\\t The\\tInuit\\tNunangat\\tPolicy\\trecognizes\\tInuit\\tNunangat\\tas\\ta\\tdistinct\\tgeographic \\tcultural\\tand\\tpolitical\\tregion\\tthat\\tforms\\t40%\\tof\\tCanada’s\\tland\\tarea \\t  \\t nearly\\tthree-quarters\\tof\\tits\\tcoastline\\tand\\tsignificant\\toffshore\\tareas.\\tIt\\talso\\tacknowledges\\tInuit\\tTreaty\\tOrganizations’\\tright\\tto\\trepresent\\tthemselves\\tnationally\\t  \\t and\\tinternationally\\tand\\tthat\\tstructurally\\tthey\\tmay\\tchoose\\tInuit\\tTapiriit\\tKanatami\\tand\\tthe\\tInuit\\tCircumpolar\\tCouncil\\tto\\trepresent\\tInuit\\tat\\tthe\\tnational\\t  \\t and\\tinternational\\tlevels\\trespectively.  39  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy i.  Arctic ambassador  The geopolitical landscape in the Arctic has become increasingly complex  and competitive. To ensure that the Canadian Arctic remains a region that  is stable  prosperous and secure  we need to deepen our engagement with  like-minded states  as well as with territorial and provincial governments   Indigenous Peoples and other domestic partners.  To lead this effort  we will establish the position of Arctic ambassador.  The ambassador’s responsibilities will include making linkages between domestic issues  and those relating to Canada’s foreign affairs; serving as Canada’s Senior Arctic Official and  advancing Canada’s polar interests in multilateral forums; engaging with counterparts in  Arctic and non-Arctic states  as well as with Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic; and raising  awareness internationally of Indigenous rights in the Arctic context. The ambassador will  also support the work of Global Affairs Canada and other departments on Arctic research  security.  In carrying out these duties  the ambassador will work closely with Arctic and  northern Indigenous Peoples  territorial and provincial governments and other northerners.   The ambassador will serve as a representative in our diplomatic corps and distinguish  himself or herself by ensuring that the Arctic Foreign Policy remains connected to the reality  of Canadians living in the Arctic. The ambassador will also play an important role in Canada’s  broader efforts toward reconciliation. The ambassador will have an office in Canada’s North.

Northern and Indigenous diplomacy      on the world stage  Canada remains committed to providing international  platforms for northerners  including territorial  provincial  and Indigenous partners and youths  to engage in and to  represent their own international Arctic views  especially  on issues that impact their rights or jurisdiction. Canada  also welcomes made-in-the-North initiatives to support  homegrown policy development that enhances northern  and Indigenous diplomacy on the world stage.    a. Sub-national governments  Arctic and northern public governments play a strategic  role in Canada’s Arctic diplomacy efforts. Canada  remains committed to including territorial government  officials in the Canadian delegation to Arctic   Council meetings.     b.  Arctic and northern Indigenous diplomacy  The Arctic Foreign Policy recommits to enhancing the  representation and participation of Arctic and northern  Indigenous Peoples in relevant negotiations and  international forums  such as the Arctic Council and the  United Nations  including the UN Permanent Forum on  Indigenous Issues  and all other bodies that Arctic and  northern Indigenous Peoples judge to affect them.  We have heard clearly from Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners that they are looking for more than  a platform where they are only one voice consulted  among many. Instead  Indigenous partners require and  demand meaningful continuous engagement to actively  partake in and shape decision making at the international  level that reflects their roles as rights holders. We will   uphold the role of Arctic and northern Indigenous   Peoples as active partners in the conduct of interna- tional relations in the Arctic and support their efforts   to advance this goal.  The Arctic Athabaskan Council  Gwich’in Council   International and the Inuit Circumpolar Council currently  sit at the Arctic Council as Permanent Participants   with membership from Canada.  Since 2020  Canada has increased funding to the   3 Permanent Participants in Canada  allowing each of  them to receive up to $650 000 each year. This support  is strengthening Indigenous voices in international Arctic  matters  particularly at the Arctic Council.  With Transport Canada  we will  support opportunities for the Inuit  Circumpolar Council Canada to  represent Inuit Knowledge and  perspectives in international forums   including on Arctic shipping and  environmental matters at the IMO.  Canada will also support similar efforts by other Arctic  and northern Indigenous Peoples to increase their  representation at relevant international forums to  ensure their rights and perspectives inform decision  making at the global level. Canada will work with   Indigenous partners to identify possible ways of   improving the capacity and role of Indigenous Peoples   in international Arctic affairs.   Canada remains strongly committed to the ANPF’s  objective of providing Arctic and northern youths with  additional opportunities to participate in  and benefit  from  Canada’s international Arctic agenda. We have  leveraged support for UArctic (an international network  of universities  colleges  research institutes and other  organizations concerned with education and research in  and about the Arctic) to provide opportunities for Canadi- ans to study in different parts of the circumpolar Arctic  to  generate regional solutions and to support collaboration  in Indigenous research and education.  41  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Photos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  iii. Northern and Indigenous representation      at Global Affairs Canada  Indigenous Peoples and northerners are   underrepresented at Global Affairs Canada  and   sustained efforts are needed to boost recruitment   and retention.  In line with the Future of Diplomacy  the department is  developing a new external recruitment strategy that will  be launched in 2025. The strategy will support outreach  across Canada to identify Canadians with the skills   needed to deliver on our various mandates and will  include specific outreach to under-represented   communities  including among Indigenous Peoples   and northerners.  To support our recruitment efforts and  increase Indigenous perspectives in the  department  we will establish a paid  Arctic and northern Indigenous youth  internship program that will consider  the need of Arctic and northern  Indigenous youths to remain close   to their families and communities   and ensure that appropriate support   is in place.  We will also work with partners to  identify other avenues for increasing  the representation of Indigenous  Peoples and northerners at Global  Affairs Canada.   42  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy 2.  Advancing Indigenous    and northern foreign    policy priorities  Broadening Canada’s international engagement to   contribute more directly to domestic issues  such as  closing socio-economic gaps  supporting infrastructure  development  enhancing knowledge of the North    protecting the Arctic environment and advancing   reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples  remains a priority.  Key issues include those described below.  i.  Cross-border mobility  First Nations  Inuit and Métis communities in Canada’s  Arctic and North share long-standing spiritual  cultural   political  economic  social and family connections with  Indigenous communities in the United States and Green- land. The introduction of modern international borders  and the associated controls on cross-border mobility  have negatively impacted Indigenous Peoples’ ability  to maintain familial  economic and cultural ties and  traditional practices.  Photos Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  Canada has been working with  Indigenous partners and the United  States  Denmark and Greenland to find  solutions to address border crossing  and migration challenges faced by First  Nations  Inuit and Métis Peoples.   This commitment is reflected in Action  Plan Measure Shared Priorities 52 of the  Action Plan to implement the United  Nations Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples Act.   To address border mobility challenges  faced by First Nations  Inuit and Métis  Peoples who live in the United States   including Alaska  Canada intends  to bring forward legislation and  regulatory measures.  43  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy ii.   Market access  Indigenous Peoples also face unjustifiable barriers to  trade—barriers that also restrict international market  access to Indigenous-harvested and -produced goods   such as seal fur and ivory products.  The traditional harvesting of seals and other species by  Inuit and other Indigenous Peoples of Canada is both  a sustainable and a valuable contributor to Arctic and  northern communities. Trade barriers by key partners   such as the United States  the European Union and other  countries  have a broad detrimental impact on life in  Canada’s remote Arctic and northern communities.  In August 2024  Canada submitted  a response to the European  Commission’s review of its regulation  on the trade of seal products. Canada  requested that the European Union  repeal its regulations and replace  them with rules that offer access   to ethically and sustainably   harvested products.  Canada will continue to advocate  for a repeal of the seal product ban.  We will also promote awareness of  sustainable seal products and harvest  management by hosting officials-level  dialogues with Arctic countries and  Indigenous partners at our missions   to the European Union and the   United States.

Indigenous Knowledge and participation  Canada supports Indigenous advocacy against pervasive  colonial approaches to Arctic science and research   which marginalize and discredit Indigenous Knowledge  and participation.  iv. Indigenous languages  Indigenous languages such as Inuktut8 are essential to  the preservation of Indigenous culture and the well-  being of Indigenous Peoples and communities. Canada  will therefore enhance its efforts to work with its Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners to facilitate the  exchange of knowledge and best practices related   to Indigenous language assessment  monitoring   and revitalization.  We will continue to support  equitable research partnerships  at the international level between  Indigenous and non-Indigenous  researchers  such as the Canada–Inuit  Nunangat–United Kingdom Arctic  Research Programme.  Looking forward  we will continue  to contribute to federal efforts on  a broader range of northern and  Indigenous priorities  and we will  collaborate with Arctic and northern  Indigenous partners  territorial  and provincial governments and  other northerners on international  advocacy as appropriate. This includes  promoting investment in critical  minerals development; transportation;  energy and electrification; broadband  connectivity; cultural diplomacy; and  the conservation of the Porcupine  caribou herd. We will also work with  Indigenous partners  Canadian Heritage  and other relevant government  departments to advocate for the  repatriation from across the globe of  artifacts originating from First Nations   Inuit and Métis communities.  8\\t Inuktut\\tis\\tthe\\tfirst\\tlanguage\\tused\\tin\\tInuit\\tNunaat \\tand\\tthe\\tmajority\\tof\\tInuit\\tNunaat\\tresidents\\tcontinue\\tto\\tspeak\\tInuktut\\tas\\ttheir\\tfirst \\tonly\\tor\\tpreferred\\tlanguage.\\t  \\t Therefore \\tto\\tuphold\\tthe\\tinherent\\tdignity\\tof\\tInuit \\tsupporting\\tInuktut\\tin\\tthis\\tcontext\\tas\\ta\\tfirst\\tor\\tlater\\tlanguage\\taligns\\twith\\tthe\\tbroader\\tpurposes\\tof \\tamong\\t  \\t other\\tthings \\tworking\\tin\\tpartnership\\tto\\tdemonstrate\\tand\\tpromote\\tshared\\trespect\\tfor\\tthe\\thistory\\tand\\timportance\\tof\\tInuktut\\tand\\tfor\\tsocio-economic\\t  \\t and\\tcultural\\tdevelopment.  45  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy v.   Supporting northern and Indigenous      trade and export  In line with Canada’s inclusive approach to trade and   its Export Diversification Strategy  we are committed   to supporting northern and Indigenous exporters in   accessing global markets.  The Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) recognizes that  building strong relationships with our northern and  Indigenous partners is key to this mission. Dedicated  trade commissioners  based in regional offices for British  Columbia and the Yukon; Alberta and the Northwest   Territories; Quebec and Nunavut; Manitoba and  Saskatchewan; and Atlantic Canada  work closely with  Canadian businesses in the Arctic and northern regions  to support their global expansion. The TCS network  also continues to actively support and develop tailored  programming for northern and Indigenous exporters   including through business delegations and export  training and accelerator programs  among other ways.  Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) into northern  and Indigenous communities will also play a vital role in  economic and infrastructure development in the region.  Through our increasing engagement with Northern and  Indigenous communities via the CanExport Community  Investments program  we will continue to support  municipalities and economic development organizations  in seeking and retaining FDI in the North while ensuring  that Canada’s environmental and national security   interests are protected.    3.  Transforming Global    \\tAffairs\\tCanada’s\\tdomestic\\t   engagement processes  We are committed to pursuing an ongoing collaborative  approach to domestic engagement that is informed by  early  sustained and meaningful engagement with   territorial and provincial governments  Arctic and   northern Indigenous governments and organizations   and northerners more generally.  46  The Arctic Cooperation Advisory  Committee is a Canadian forum  for the engagement of relevant  federal departments  territorial  and provincial governments and  Permanent Participant partners on the  development and implementation of  Canada’s international Arctic policy   including Arctic-Council-related  matters. It will remain an important  mechanism for dialogue and  engagement on the development and  implementation of Canada’s Arctic  Foreign Policy.   We are committed to exploring  distinctions-based engagements with  First Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty  and Self-Governing Partners from  Canada’s Arctic and North.  For example  we are committed to  engaging directly with Inuit through the  Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee as  we apply the Inuit Nunangat Policy to  our programs  policies and services.  In addition  we will expand  opportunities for territorial and  provincial governments and Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners to  join or support Canadian delegations  at bilateral or international Arctic  meetings and treaty negotiations if  in  such meetings and negotiations  their  rights or interests could potentially   be impacted.   We will also continue to provide a  critical coordination function for  multi-stakeholder Arctic events to  support a strong Canadian presence.  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy CONCLUSION  The Arctic is a region of tremendous opportunity thanks  to its plentiful resources and resilient people.   However  Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine  rapidly   advancing climate change and increasing interest in  the Arctic from non-Arctic states has led to increased  competition and geopolitical tension in the region.   To ensure that the Arctic remains stable  prosperous and  secure and to fully implement the objectives laid out  in the International chapter of the ANPF  Canada needs  a diplomatic strategy that responds to this evolving  geopolitical context.  The Arctic Foreign Policy reorients Canada’s approach  to the Arctic based on a clear-eyed assessment of the  threats Canada faces today  and those it anticipates in  the future. It aligns Canada’s foreign and defence policy  to ensure the security of Canadians and ensures that  together with its allies  Canada can guard against and  defend itself against threats from its adversaries   in the Arctic.  By reinforcing the pillars of Arctic governance and the  principles of the rules-based international order  this  policy will help to safeguard the collective interests   of the peoples of the Arctic from those who would   seek to impose their wills.   This policy will strengthen our relationships with   territorial and provincial governments  Arctic and   northern Indigenous governments and organizations   and other northerners. It will produce new and more  effective ways of working together on Arctic diplomacy  that will transform Canada’s approach   to international engagement.  Canadian diplomacy has a role to play in building  renewed relationships with First Nations  Inuit  Métis   Modern Treaty and Self-Governing Partners; relationships  that are based on the recognition of rights  respect   and partnership.  The Arctic Foreign Policy is built on a vision of shared  cooperation and prosperity for all the peoples of the  Arctic who are committed to peace and stability.   Together  we can realize this future and ensure Canada’s  place as a leader in the Arctic for generations to come.  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  47  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy Annex: Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   development process and Canada’s Arctic   and\\tNorthern\\tPolicy\\tFramework\\t(ANPF) \\t  published in 2019  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   development process  In the spirit of the principle of “nothing about us without  us ” the Arctic Foreign Policy was developed on the basis  of extensive and distinctions-based engagement and  on collaboration and cooperation with domestic rights  holders from Canada’s Arctic and North  including First  Nations  Inuit  Métis  Modern Treaty and Self-Governing  Partners and organizations; the territorial governments  (the Northwest Territories  Nunavut and the Yukon);  and provincial governments (Manitoba  Newfoundland  and Labrador and Quebec). We engaged partners in a  variety of formats  including bilateral meetings  regional  round-table discussions and ANPF   governance mechanisms.  The Arctic Foreign Policy is guided by all relevant  treaties and self-government agreements with Arctic  and northern Indigenous partners  including obligations  Canada has to Indigenous Peoples under those treaties  and agreements  and the rights recognized and affirmed  under section 35 of the Constitution Act  1982. It is further  guided by the Yukon Northern Affairs Program   Devolution Transfer Agreement (2003)  the Northwest  Territories Devolution Agreement (2014)  the United  Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  (endorsed by Canada in 2020)  the Inuit Nunangat Policy  (2022) and the Nunavut Lands and Resources Devolution   Agreement (2024).  The policy development process was also informed by  engagement with like-minded Arctic states; specifically   the Kingdom of Denmark  Finland  Iceland  Norway   Sweden and the United States.    48  Photo Credit: © Global Affairs Canada  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy   Canada’s ANPF  Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy complements and  supports the implementation of the ANPF  which was  published in 2019. The ANPF was co-developed with  over 25 First Nations  Inuit and Métis governments and  organizations  as well as with territorial and   provincial governments.   The ANPF sets out a common vision of a future where  Arctic and northern peoples are thriving  strong and  safe. The framework includes a co-developed policy  statement and the whole-of-government International  chapter  which articulates Canada’s goals and objectives  for the circumpolar Arctic in 3 key areas that   remain in effect:  1. Strengthening the rules-based   international order in the Arctic   2. More clearly defining Canada’s    Arctic boundaries   3. Broadening Canada’s international    engagement to contribute to the priorities   of the Canadian Arctic   The implementation of the International chapter has  been supported by Global Affairs Canada’s Global   Arctic Leadership Initiative with an annual budget   of $7 million each year to strengthen Canada’s global   leadership in the Arctic.  The ANPF’s Safety  security and defence chapter also  underlines the importance of strengthening cooperation  with international partners on safety  security   and defence issues.  Canada remains committed to strengthening Arctic   and northern infrastructure and to closing infrastructure  gaps with other regions of Canada to forge opportunities   for economic development  to address reconciliation    to increase resilience and to contribute to Arctic defence  and security.
